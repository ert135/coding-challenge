China is embarking upon a huge increase in nuclear capacity to 58 GWe by 2020; India's target is to add 20 to 30 new reactors by 2030. Communities in Finland and Sweden have accepted the local construction of permanent disposal sites for nuclear waste. International cooperation and commerce in the field of nuclear science and technology is growing.
