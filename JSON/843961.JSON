The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Menu Anthony Watts / March 14, 2011 By Mike Smith There is no question that the events in Japan are ongoing and serious.  That said, I believe a lot of people are being misled by much of the  news coverage.  Take a look at these headlines from the Christian Science Monitor and from Channel News Asia , respectively, and, “Three Mile Island” and “Chernobyl” sounds scary, right? Let me ask a couple of questions?  How many were killed by the Three Mile Island incident? 100?
