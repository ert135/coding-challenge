DEFINITION:  “Nanomaterials   describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 and 1000 nanometres (10  −9   meter) but is usually 1—100","m_szDocBody":"cielotech online carpe diem home top timewaster attribute greatachiever bob jackson successful engineering resume technical writing grow anindividual nanomaterial recent month
