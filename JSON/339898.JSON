And when you burn it or use it to produce electricity, the only waste product is water. In the era of global warming, it would seem to be the perfect fuel. So why aren't we all driving round in hydrogen-powered cars, moving our goods in hydrogen-powered lorries, and heating our homes and offices with this wonder element?
