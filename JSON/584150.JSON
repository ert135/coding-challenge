The system can have a heating source, a superheater, an expander, a receiver, an absorber, a desorber, and regenerator with pumps and controls. The superheater heats a working fluid (a refrigerant or steam). A positive liquid/vapor expander expands a low temperature refrigerant, or steam vapor to the saturated state (having both liquid and vapor parts) utilizing a low-pressure sub-atmospheric exhaust sink.
