Once electricity is generated from an energy reservoir, which can supplied by any type of energy sources, the electric current has to be used instantaneously by an electricity consuming device, or be lost otherwise. The only way to resolve this inherent disadvantage of electricity is to have energy storage systems that can save the ","m_szDocBody":"santiago miret phd student material science engineering comment
