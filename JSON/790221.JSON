May 29th, 2008 by Rod Adams   As a long time proponent of the increased use of nuclear energy, I have been involved in thousands of conversations on the topic. (Trust me, I am a boring guest at a cocktail party and a real pain around the water cooler.) Nearly every one of them eventually included the comment that sounds like a question but is usually offered as a trump card aimed at stopping the conversation – “That sounds pretty good, Rod, but what do you do about the waste?” That is the point where – if the person that I am speaking to has n","m_szDocBody":"waste recycle reuse rod adam long time proponent increased nuclear energy involved
