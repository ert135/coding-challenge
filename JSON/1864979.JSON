The seeds of the revolution are: - Contour crafting (scaling up inkjet/rapid prototyping up to making buildings, cement jet) Use cement as the ink. Layer by layer additive construction. 200 times faster than conventional methods. 5 times lower cost for construction. - Inflatable electric cars. Flatship cars from a factory like Ikea furniture and could be as cheap as $2500 for an environmentally friendly car. - ","m_szDocBody":"modelling enabling manufacturing construction revolution recently discussed seed manufacturing construction revolution seed revolution are contour crafting scaling prototyping making building cement jet cement ink layer layer additive construction time faster conventional method time lower cost construction inflatable electric car flatship car factory ikea furniture cheap environmentally friendly car reel reel production electronic hundred thousand time faster current lithography factory making computer factory making electronic television video monitor seed wafer scale assembly nanoscale component nanotube material nanosteel withstand higher temperature retain strength wood based fibre make paper cardboard stronger cast iron cheap plentiful material strong application making time faster require lot planning prevent unintended problem method today building information modelling city planning level well modelling planning manufacturing construction revolution computer model building created extract detailed plan subsystem cooling water electrical wiring economist magazine talk shift architect blueprint database amount data variable modelled increased denser data version life virtual world modelling made proposed construction planned end life elaborate digital model city architecture city planning dimensional profession modelling estimate schedule simulate building information management detail greater fed life virtual reality scenarios faster realtime simulation mode inexpensive realtime sensor tracking aspect safety feeding model update current situation time infrastructure health surrounding system building relative maintenance task actual emission building traffic people flow usage pattern rapid cheap construction address california dike problem advanced city planning detailed data frequent update city larger scale link subject below open geospatial bim accelerating economy accelerating economy maintaining improving safety require coordination effort train move faster fewer delay require planning coordination effort mundane speedup not nanofactory level molecular nanotechnology artificial general intelligence flesh requirement mnt speed level faster speed require consideration time faster construction time cheque week day time faster mean minute turnaround prechecked approved time mean interested party issue prethought work pipeline year advance preplanned city wide wiki intersection project software project planning required enable level plan queue simulation softwareagent pass comment validation modularized disconnected safely compartimentalized simplicity speed retained higher safe development speed growth internet time economy robin hanson correct economic singularity real long economic boom reading ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/06/modelling-and-enabling-manufacturing.html","m_Places":["California","Dike","Advanced City","Bim","Reading"],"m_People":["Robin Hanson"],"m_Companies":["Revolution","Ikea","Second Life"],"m_BiGrams":["time faster","manufacturing construction","construction revolution","city planning"],"m_TriGrams":["manufacturing construction revolution"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[5,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":339}
