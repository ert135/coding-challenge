However, just a few years ago the idea of transferring ultra-massive quantities of seawater out of the ocean and putting it to use on land was a lot less realistic than it is today, mainly because of the massive amount of energy required to pump, desalinate and transport it. What has changed is the availability of low cost, low impact renewable energy technologies, as demonstrated by a new renewable energy desalination project in Masdar, Abu Dhabi. The new project, which aims to establish a commercially viable renewable energy-powered desalin","m_szDocBody":"tina casey erprobably not however year ago idea transferring ultramassive quantity seawater ocean putting land lot realistic today massive amount energy required pump desalinate transport changed availability low cost low impact renewable energy technology demonstrated renewable energy desalination project masdar abu dhabi project aim establish commercially viable renewable energypowered desalination plant launched part closing ceremony annual international water summit masdar part sixth annual world future energy summit annual abu dhabi sustainability week renewable energy desalination international renewable energy agency irena issued comprehensive increasing renewable energy desalinate seawater corrado sommariva president international desalination neat summary importance transitioning desalination industry renewable energy initial focus middle east provide reliable source fresh water ensure beginning blossoming region economy emphasis include making desalination sustainable environmentally responsible industrial solutionnot desalination industry continued development success region community large renewable energy trend important gcc gulf cooperation council region middle east account half world desalinated water sommariva note increasing renewable energy desalination balanced availability renewable energy general grid word renewable energypowered desalination make sense parallel effort build renewable energy capacity grid process improvement enable desalination facility operate greater efficiency noted fossil fuelexporting nation considerable renewable energy resource position sustain export operation renewable energy home note caution sustainable desalination fall sustainable city sustainable development conference abu dhabi hassan fath masdar institute cautioned assuming renewable energy obstacle sustainable desalination fath generating renewable energy case solar thermal power run desalination facility part challenge region globe face set circumstance based characteristic local seawater gcc gulf cooperation council region thermal desalination continue leading technology reason wellknown gulf water temperature salinity turbidity marine life addition presence radioactive material warship nuclear power plant addressed fath noted extreme phenomena red tide algae bloom desalination plant shut down level boron result reverse osmosis process concern say usa meanwhile hasnt sitting desalination improvement example team researcher mit tackling desalination energy efficiency angle filtration system based atomthin sheet graphene navy deep interest mobile desalination processe developing prototype transportable energyefficient desalination unit energy conventional unit interesting development project university colorado denver microbe treat wastewater generating electricity hydrogen gas power desalination component single integrated facility image water syvwlch follow twitter note gulf cooperation council formed include arabian peninsula country saudi arabia kuwait bahrain qatar united arab emirate sultanate oman cleantechnica abu dhabi sustainability week cheque archive page abu dhabi sustainability week world future energy summit international renewable energy conference cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag abu dhabi sustainability week desalination energy efficient desalination international water summit irena desalination masdar desalination renewable energy desalination solar powered desalination sustainable desalination world future energy summit tina casey specialise military corporate sustainability advanced technology emerging material biofuel water wastewater issue tinas article reposted frequently reuter scientific american site view expressed own follow google related post ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2013/01/19/solar-powered-desalination-plants-to-combat-rising-sea-levels/","m_Places":["Abu Dhabi","Middle East","Sustainable Cities","United States","Denver","Arabian Peninsula","Saudi Arabia","Kuwait","Bahrain","Qatar","United Arab Emirates","Sultanate Of Oman"],"m_People":["Tina Casey","Corrado Sommariva","Hassan Fath","Fath"],"m_Companies":["Energy Agency","Desalination Association","Gcc","Gulf Cooperation Council","Masdar Institute","U.s.
