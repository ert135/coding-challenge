By Kari Lydersen |Thursday, May 28, 2015 RELATED TAGS: ENERGY , SUSTAINABILITY Chesky/Shutterstock We take it for granted that electricity will flow to our light bulbs, computers and microwaves at exactly the moment we need it. We owe that reliability to the electric grid, a vast and complicated machine that constantly adjusts to balance the supply of electricity coming in from power plants, wind turbines and solar panels
