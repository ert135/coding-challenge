Mitsubishi is also one of Japan's key defense contractors, building the Type 10 main battle tank and Soryu-class attack submarine. Its AAM-4B medium range air-to-air missile was the first with an advanced electronically scanned array radar, making it even more advanced than the American AMRAAM missile. Now Mitsubishi wants to get into self-driving cars, and it reckons that its military technology will give it a leg up on the competition.
