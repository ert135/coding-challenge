Scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Ruhr University Bochum (Germany), the Ecole normale superieure (ENS) de Lyon, Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (France) and Leiden University (Netherlands) developed a new method which elegantly correlates geometric and adsorption properties of catalysts.
