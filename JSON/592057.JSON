It relies on conductors, transformers and other bulky infrastructure. The setup works, but with powerful next generation weapons on the horizon and the omnipresent goal of energy efficiency, the Navy is seeking alternatives to conventional power control systems. One option involves using graphene , which, since its discovery in 2004, has become the material of choice for researchers working to","m_szDocBody":"navy eye graphene nanoribbon ultimate power control system cory nealon navy distribute electricity aboard ship power company rely conductor transformer bulky infrastructure setup work powerful generation weapon horizon omnipresent goal energy efficiency navy seeking alternative conventional power control system option involve graphene which discovery material choice researcher working improve solar cell smartphone battery accordingly office naval research awarded university buffalo engineer grant develop narrow strip graphene called nanoribbon someday revolutionise power controlled ship smartphone electronic device develop nanomaterial capable handling greater amount energy density smaller device graphene nanoribbon show remarkable promise endeavour cemal basaran phd professor ubs department civil structural environmental engineering school engineering applied science grant principal investigator graphene single layer carbon atom packed honeycomb extremely thin light strong conductor heat electricity the beauty graphene grown biological organism opposed manufacturing material traditional technique basaran director ubs electronic packaging laboratory these bioinspired material control atomic organisation controlling genetic dna makeup labgrown cell promising researcher beginning understand graphene potential use area interest power control system overhead power line ship rely copper metal move electricity unfortunately process inefficient electron bash create heat process called joule heating you lose great deal energy way basaran say with graphene avoid collision conduct electricity process semiballistic conduction highspeed bullet train versus bumper car limitation metalbased power distribution bulky infrastructure transistor copper wire transformer etc needed move electricity ship tablet computer component space add weight graphene nanoribbon offer potential solution act conductor instead copper semiconductor instead silicon moreover ability withstand failure extreme energy load roughly time greater copper bode navy which segment automotive industry pivoting electric vehicle recently launched allelectric destroyer ship propeller drive shaft turned electric motor opposed connected combustion engine integrated powergeneration distribution system fire generation weapon railgun powerful laser automation allowed navy reduce ship crew place fewer sailor potentially dangerous situation graphene nanoribbon improve system making robust energyefficient basaran said team researcher will design complex simulation examine graphene nanoribbon power switch explore adding hydrogen element process doping graphene nanoribbon improve performance investigate graphene nanoribbon failure limit power load way improve research performed year ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://phys.org/news/2015-07-navy-eyes-graphene-nanoribbon-ultimate.html","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Cory Nealon","Cemal","He"],"m_Companies":["Us Navy","U.s.
