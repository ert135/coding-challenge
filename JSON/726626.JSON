Now, EU climate chief Connie Hedegaard has added that offshore wind energy is cheaper than nuclear. Offshore Wind Energy is Very, Very Cheap — Cheaper than Nuclear You often see people claiming that nuclear energy is so cheap — (I always wonder if their figures are based on what nuclear energy projects are projected to cost or the actual cost of such projects, which often ends up bei","m_szDocBody":"offshore wind energy cheaper nuclear energy climate chief zachary shahan wrote short piece
