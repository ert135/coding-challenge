Not just gasoline cars, but other electric cars. Unlike gasoline cars, truly electric cars can be divided up into modules. Different fuels—gasoline, electricity from batteries, hydrogen—can be used to power the car by replacing a power unit. Car bodies can be updated to conform to changing fashion. Even while keeping the motors that power the car, still good for a million miles.
