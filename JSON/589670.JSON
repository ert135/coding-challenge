Here is how the energy system functions: During daytime, excess solar power from PV panels is directed to run electrolyzers and produce hydrogen. Said hydrogen can then be transformed back into electricity using a fuel cell storage system at night. Some 114 kW of photovoltaic panels will be capable of generating around 441 kWh of daily electricity.
