Researchers are eyeballing the clean power – hydrogen nexus for a much broader application that leverages carbon from agricultural biomass to sustain an entire economy with electricity, fuel, food, and chemical products. The Hydrogen Economy, Then & Now For those of you new to the topic, hydrogen is an alluringly energy-dense fuel, which is why it","m_szDocBody":"clean power concept leverage hydrogen biomass tina
