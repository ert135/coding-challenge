Lisa Clausen reports on those at the forefront of game-changing Australian research. Three clear bottles stand like trophies on an otherwise empty shelf in Professor Dan Li's office at Melbourne's Monash University. Two are filled with powder the colour of midnight, while the third contains a lump of silver-grey rock. They're all forms of graphite, a type of coal we all rely on somehow, whether it's in brake lining, batteries or pencils.
