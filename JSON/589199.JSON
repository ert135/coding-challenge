As Peplow notes, funding for the US HFC programme was slashed in 2009. However, the US Department of Energy (DOE) had been led to believe that battery technology was on the verge of offering the vehicle ranges and recharging times needed for mass market sales. When this proved to be wrong, funding was returned to the DOE HFC programme, albeit quietly to conceal the politically embarrassing volte-face.    Existing battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) are ideal for short-range, predictable city-type usage.
