The need to reduce CO2 emissions is renewing interest in nuclear energy. What are the new nuclear technologies and how do they improve upon existing nuclear plants? Hydrogen Fuel Cells There are no natural reservoirs of pure hydrogen; this resource must be extracted from compounds such as natural gas or water. Hydrogen fuel cells have the potential to drastically reduce U.S. dependence on foreign sources of energy.
