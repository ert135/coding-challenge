It only included one car. Since then a few readers have emailed to ask if I could do a similar comparison, but for cars only. So here’s a very brief guide to vehicle emissions. In the graph above I’ve compared the full vehicle emissions of four petrol cars (20, 30, 40 and 50 MPG) to that of an electr","m_szDocBody":"posted keyword carbon decarbonization electricity energy security tech efficiency environmental policy cleantech renewable energy fuel automobile green car vehicle emission month back post called world greenest vehicle included car reader emailed similar comparison car only here guide vehicle emission graph compared full vehicle emission petrol car mpg electric vehicle type electricity coal oil gas solar case include emission vehicle manufacturing full scope petrol electricity emission wonk call welltowheel manufacturing result pretty clear fuel economy petrol car lower emission electric car major difference source ofelectricity lowest emission distance electric car solar electricity chosen solar coownership solar evs emission low hydro nuclear wind low carbon electricity promised diesel slightly petrol particulate problem electric car low carbon vehicle future nextgen biofuel hydrogen fuel cell vehicle emission cheque post electric vehicle emission driving emission world greenest vehicle bob meinetz say lindsay point coownership solar pevs electric car charged night practise solar make small contribution transportation will fortunate work home charge work trouble massive array deliver current amp wall charger typical array entire southern california day incapable completely charging nissan leaf remark emission low solar hydro nuclear wind low carbon electricity excessively kind solar practical term leaning lot natural gas assistance emission low hydro nuclear wind low carbon electricity read emission low hydro nuclear wind low carbon electricity read low hydro nuclear wind low carbon electricity read low hydro nuclear wind low carbon electricity nathan wilson say make car low carbon emission avoid expense range limitation battery carbonfree fuel amveh prototype car run carbonfree amonia fuel built south korean institute energy research kier slightly modified internal combustion engine rather expensive fuel cell low cost approach potential scale rapidly kier studying method make ammonia renewable energy along water air costly moment ammonia made fossil fuel cc&s cost competitive gasoline ammonia fuel easier scale carbonfree fuel hydrogen reason ammonia liquid psi time energy density psi hydrogen greatly ease problem car maker providing adequate range hydrogen fueled vehicle energy density mean ammonia delivered refuelling station truck hydrogen delivering expensive pipeline ammonia refrigeration stored large nonpressurized tank seasonal energy storage practicle ","m_szGeo1":"","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.theenergycollective.com/lindsay-wilson/372286/what-s-greenest-car-extremely-short-guide-vehicle-emissions#comments","m_Places":["California"],"m_People":["Nathan Wilson","Kier"],"m_Companies":["Cleantech","Mpg","Diesel","Korean Institute For Energy Research"],"m_BiGrams":["low carbon","hydro nuclear","nuclear wind","wind low","carbon electricity","vehicle emission","low hydro","electric car","emission low","electricity read"],"m_TriGrams":["hydro nuclear wind","nuclear wind low","wind low carbon","low carbon electricity","low hydro nuclear","emission low hydro","carbon electricity read"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[8,6,6,6,6,5,5,4,4,3],"m_TriCnt":[6,6,6,6,5,3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":342}
