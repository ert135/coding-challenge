wage rising easily raise price losing customer cost rise area operation tend cut cost areas operation offset rise crowding principle work sector increasingly inefficient operation directly affect businesse oil metal mineral healthcare areas cost cut make rising cost areas include lower interest rate interest rate low reduce expense businesse make customer tolerate higher cost say automobile
