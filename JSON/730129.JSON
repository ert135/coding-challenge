I’m not going to repeat most of the nonsense, since it might then stick in your head and you might forget that it’s nonsense somewhere down the road. However,  Karl-Friedrich Lenz just had a great post debunking statements — some of the most common German energy myths — fr","m_szDocBody":"debunking common myth nuclear coal power germany germany
