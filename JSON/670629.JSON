However, Li metal anodes suffer from ‘dead’ Li formation and surface deactivation which consequently form a porous layer of redundant Li aggregates. In this work, a fibrous metal felt (FMF) as a three-dimensional conductive interlayer was introduced between the separator and the Li metal anode to improve the reversibility of
