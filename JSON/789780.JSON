In fact, we have defined and redefined its use. But what is energy? Scientists define it as “the ability to do work” — anything from manufacturing a box to carrying it, for example. The most important aspect of energy is that it enables some kind of change. Mechanical energy usually comes to mind first. There are two different forms of it: kinetic (energy th","m_szDocBody":"energy electric power sandy dechert day human learned fire developed simple machine progressed lot ability harness external
