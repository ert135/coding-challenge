They said you might wish to put on some plastic gloves to hold it, although that would not be necessary if you washed your hands afterwards. You look down at the metal resting on your palm. It feels heavy, because it’s very dense. You are then told that this metal golf ball can provide all the energy you will ever use in your life. That includes running your lights, computer, air conditioner, TV, electric c","m_szDocBody":"ifr fad lifetime energy palm yourhand newspaper year wrote following imagine handed lump silvery metal size
