We asked you to submit questions in advance and during the event, and we received more questions than we could answer. So now I am answering some of your questions that went unanswered. Can you discuss fuel cells for residential and commercial buildings and their cost?  — from TydeFarm ","m_szDocBody":"energy industry new analysis commentary asked answering fuel cell question
