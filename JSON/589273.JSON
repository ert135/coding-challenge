(Image credit: Toyota). Welsh physicist William Grove and German physicist Christian Friedrich Schönbein conceptualized and developed the first prototype fuel cell in 1839. While the technology has made great strides over the past 175 years, it has yet to reach mass adoption due to its high cost and relatively low efficiency.
