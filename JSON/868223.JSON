The research showed that in hot conditions, the membrane, which features a water repellent skin, could improve the efficiency of fuel cells by a factor of four. Young Moo Lee from Hanyang University, who led the research, predicted that this could have major implications for many industries, incl","m_szDocBody":"type natureinspired membrane significantly boost performance fuel cell transform electric vehicle industry researcher foundthe membrane developed scientist csiro hanyang university korea nature research showed hot condition membrane feature water repellent skin improve efficiency fuel cell factor fouryoung moo lee hanyang university led research predicted major implication industry including development electric vehicle csiro researcher coauthor aaron thornton skin work similar cactus plant thrive retaining water harsh arid environmentsfuel cell electric vehicle generate energy mixing simple gase hydrogen oxygen thornton said however order maintain performance proton exchange membrane fuel cell stay constantly hydrated moment achieved placing cell alongside radiator water reservoir humidifier thornton addedmeanwhile csiro researcher coauthor cara doherty noted cactusinspired solution alternativea cactus plant tiny crack called stomatal pore open night cool humid close day condition hot arid doherty said help retain water water generated electrochemical reaction regulated nanocrack skin crack widen exposed humidifying condition close drier doherty explainedthis mean fuel cell remain hydrated bulky external humidifier equipment found skin made fuel cell time efficient hot dry condition doherty added ian tag battery cactus electric vehicle industry electric vehicle fuel cell read ","m_szGeo1":"India","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/cactus-inspired-membrane-can-improve-fuel-cell-performance-spurs-electric-vehicle-industry-312589.html","m_Places":["Korea"],"m_People":["Aaron Thornton","Cara Doherty"],"m_Companies":["Csiro","Hanyang University","Ians"],"m_BiGrams":["fuel cell","electric vehicle"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,5],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":181}
