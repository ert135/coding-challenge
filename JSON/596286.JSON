Right now, batteries are hot, but what about fuel cells? We put the question to Reuss. Mark Brush/Michigan Radio 4:00 Listen to today's Environment Report. Battery-powered cars and trucks seem to be winning the day as the way forward to increase fuel efficiency and to cut carbon pollution. But there was a time when we heard a lot about fuel cells. The cells convert hydrogen into electricity that can then power a car or truck. That hype died down as people realiz","m_szDocBody":"hydrogenpowered car make miracle gms mark reuss talk upcoming release chevy bolt now battery hot fuel cell put question reuss mark radio listen
