Since smaller thorium molten-salt power plant are easier to construct, TTS will develop the 10,000kW micro-mini thorium molten-salt power plant 'miniFUJI' within five years (by 2016). This micro-mini power plant is planned as a local power plant to meet the high need of power supply for servers in information industry and fo","m_szDocBody":"thorium tech solution japanese company working small thorium molten salt reactor kazuo furukawa inventor minifuji fuji molten salt reactor masaaki furukawa set thorium tech solution tts make thorium molten salt reactor smaller thorium moltensalt power plant easier construct tts develop micromini thorium moltensalt power plant minifuji year micromini power plant planned local power plant meet power supply server information industry station charging electric vehicle smartplanet report thorium tech solution tts combine plutonium actinide japan some reactor liquid thorium alternative today uranium fuel people offer safety cost efficiency antiweapon advantage article give quick review ycombinator stumbleupon author ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://nextbigfuture.com/2014/04/thorium-tech-solutions-is-japanese.html","m_Places":["Fuji","Japan"],"m_People":["Kazuo Furukawa","Masaaki Furukawa"],"m_Companies":["Tts"],"m_BiGrams":["power plant","thorium tech","tech solution","molten salt","salt reactor"],"m_TriGrams":["thorium tech solution","molten salt reactor"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[4,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":96}
