The higher the efficiency of the economy the lower the impact on the environment. The highest impact comes from agriculture, followed by the energy industry. They both experienced a remarkable efficiency gain in the past 200 years. However, production and use of energy for electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, industrial, and commercial have varying degrees of impact on our environment, and in recent years, the
