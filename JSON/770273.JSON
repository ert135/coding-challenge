PESN 2008 PESN 2007 December 2007 Waste to Energy > Download (13 mb; mp3) - Paul Pabor, VP of Renewable Energy, Waste Management , the company that comes around to haul off garbage, is increasingly turning some of that garbage into energy -- enough to power over one million homes -- the equivalent of 14 million barrels of oil per year or 3.6 million tons of coal. And the company has a goal to double that amount to 2 million homes by 2020.
