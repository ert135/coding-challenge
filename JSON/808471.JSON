Energy is a characteristic of the system which describes the ability of the system to perform some work. According to the international system of units, in honor of the English physicist James Prescott Joule-in (1818 â€“ 1889), a unit of measure for energy is called the joule (J). Important feature of energy is that energy can neither arise nor perish, and therefore the amount of energy in a closed system is always constant. This energy feature is called the energy preservation law, which was","m_szDocBody":"energy conclusion word energy derived greek word meaning energos meaning activity energy characteristic system
