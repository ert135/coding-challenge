Laser-wielding physicists find promising hints February 12, 2014 | By Amina Khan Scientists have been trying to harness the secrets of star power since the days of the Cold War. Now, using a 2-millimeter capsule housed in a cavernous building roughly the length of three football fields, researchers have conducted a landmark experiment, using lasers to create the merest hint of controlled nuclear fusion that produced more energy than was put into the fuel alone.     “This is really an important milestone,” said UCLA plasma physicist Warren Mori, who was not involved in the work.","m_szDocBody":"nuclear fusion laserwielding physicist promising hint amina khan scientist harness secret star power day cold war now millimetre capsule housed cavernous building roughly
