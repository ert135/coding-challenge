Power plants for generating electricity cost billions of dollars, which is very expensive by any standard, and a plant's cost must be borne by the utility that will sell its output. A utility will therefore not build a power plant unless it is needed and will yield an eventual profit. How does a utility decide to build such a plant? Over the first 70 years of this century, the consumption of electricity grew at a steady rate of 7% per year, doubling every 10 years.
