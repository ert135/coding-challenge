The Hearing Index, which takes into account parameters such as the capacity to accept background noise during a conversation, to understand a person talking when there is a lot of background noise present, or to properly hear a person talking in a fairly quiet room, is better in more “quiet” countries such as Germany, where 23% of the population has a good Hearing Index, compared to a mean of 18% for all other countries.
