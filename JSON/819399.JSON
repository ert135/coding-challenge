Size of the largest piecem: 0.3 x 4cm. @ images-of-elements.com Lithium, the lowest density metallic element, is in a group of elements called alkali metals or Group I elements and is silvery-white in color. It has the atomic number of 3. The alkali metals group includes lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs). The three alkali metals are highly reactive with oxygen and water, so they are typically stored in oil.
