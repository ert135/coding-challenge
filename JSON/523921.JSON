In this post, we will look at some supporting data showing how this connection works. The data is over a very long time periodâ€“some of it going back to the Year 1 C. E.

economic growth rate period average percent growth real gdp selected group based usda gdp data back financial crisis oil price stayed low united state began programme quantitative easing helping interest rate extra low providing extra liquidityoil price immediately began rising again barrel level remaining level combination low interest rate price encouraged oil production shale formation helping world oil production rising drop oil production north sea alaska mexico thus while conflict price ability economy pay price resolved favour price oil pricesaround barrelcontinued united state tapered stopped time china made made debt difficult obtain factor longterm adverse impact barrel oil price economy brought oil price current level barrel figure barrel price relative cost oil infrastructure built low relative current cost oil production world oil supply production including biofuel natural gas liquid brent monthly average spot price based eia data person back clear oil price brought oil consumption early period late early oil consumption continued rise price additional oil shale low price encountering message networked economy saying economy afford oil price level
