imagine lot startup silicon valleythat hadthat sort success rate laugh levineoh yeah mean itsamazing that andthe idea wasthe conceit really stage this nmcin bold superbattery mile single charge lift electric car green niche mainstream superbattery car mile mile charge quest envia after quest argonne croweand year super detailynuance chemistryor said niche product starting emergence commercial aspect said chevy volt coming outteslas nasdaqtsla coming model pretty soontoyotasmaking push sorry actually toyotas hydrogen fuel cell levine fuel cell crowe bit different but year there observing seeing biggest challenge battery now take niche product massmarket product competitive traditional internal combustion engine levine running physic challenge pack energy small space low price battery volt model long way mile single charge car produce which volt end year tesla unveil model sale challenge current pathway there superbattery electrochemical pandemoniumthat haywire battery arrest that pathway catches fire red line drive electric car catch fire crowe weird stigma though because mean driving giant fuel gasoline tank year catch fire reasonthat issue levine right right crowe now guess levine yeah then pathway people talk about siliconputting silicon thebattery swell put silicon electrode battery swell time size shatter battery shortcircuit anyway say short sentence work real superbattery but car coming market year beginning stage valley death however sort side sight crowe and actually that bit late studying couple year watching industry going argonne national lab startup make announcement change explain layman this watch happen breakthrough like wow worth talking writing about levine yeah rich bill gate thing make silicon work battery announcement startup lab whatever figured put silicon anode battery pathway pure metallic lithium holy grail make electric car sidebyside competitive internal combustion engine and incidentally lot battery liar there field full exaggerator hypester huckster happen just likemicrosoft crowe mmhmm fascinating that because said book challenge like battery degrade time fix sort thing kind line effectively silicon pure metallic lithium versus the guess oxide working past couple year said precipice valley death light bit end tunnel lot theme popping work stuff bloomberg media outlet touting rate adoption electric vehicle ability completely upend oil market book talk bit valley death battery automotive valley death coming end foresee rate adoption electric vehicle starting off levine uncertain thing major carmaker year starting nowstarting beginning year running middle end period year major carmaker starting withgm nysegm marketing mainstream electric car question bought people pay chevy volt large number elon musk model car cost subsidy doubt that say bought large number hundred thousand unit end valley death crowe underestimated talk adoption rate electric vehicle number like sold thenissanleaf year range compared pickup truck fromford nysef month levine yeah crowe rate adoption talking about much larger scale kind talking day today levine well are think tyler signal heading valley death electric
