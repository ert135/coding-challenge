Crescent Dunes is based on molten salt thermal technology and we say notorious because when completed, Crescent Dunes will give the U.S. bragging rights to the largest renewable energy plant of its kind in the world. In certain quarters, however, the project is also notorious because it benefited from a federally backed construction loan to the ","m_szDocBody":"tina casey notorious crescent dune solar energy plant tonopah nevada passed milestone month worker finished placing receiver panel top foot tower form centrepiece facility crescent dune based molten salt thermal technology notorious completed crescent dune give bragging right largest renewable energy plant kind world quarter however project notorious benefited federally backed construction loan tune whopping million creating potentially juicy opportunity critic obama administration renewable energy policy rooting failure crescent dune track completion end year salt kevin dooley flickr crescent dune molten salt solar thermal power plant make crescent dune unique commercialscale solar power plant integrated energy storage system developer solarreserve facility provide hour full power storage enable supply power ondemand basis fossil fuel nuclear power plant crescent dune similar conventional concentrating solar power csp system thousand special mirror called heliostat focus solar energy central tower difference molten salt flow receiver panel top tower consisting alloy tube salt retain solar energy form heat ranging temperature degree fahrenheit degree enable salt double energy transfer energy storage mechanism unlike water molten salt remain liquid state temperature enabling transported ground level stored inexpensive system pipe tank asneeded basis heated salt boil water operate steamdriven turbine part process conventional fossil fuel power plant crescent dune green job recent spate new chinas horrific smoginduced public health crisis reminder weve managed decouple economic growth worst effect fossil fuel dependency however public health cost fossil fuel dependency linger plenty wiggle room create firm platform sustainable economic growth reducing pollution further clean renewable energy project crescent dune blowback conservative legislator republican representative nevada bat crescent dune winwin economic engine state project nevada bragging right cutting edge solar thermal technology designed solarreserve technology partner including rocket science pioneer pratt whitney rocketdyne make big difference nevada find lagging arizona governor brewer apparently shelved climate change denial favour aggressive push woo clean tech startup state currently worker construction site total job expected length month construction period job add total direct indirect induced job expected construction operational megawatt facility provide power home peak period pump million annually economy form salary operating cost crescent dune keystone pipeline reminder promote economic growth employment opportunity adding significant capacity power grid exposing community risk impact fossil fuel harvesting transportation fossil fuel project proposed keystone tar sand oil pipeline touted create job latest argument occurred arkansas existing exxon tar sand oil pipeline ruptured spilling oil residential area threatening nearby lake meanwhile arkansas midwestern state considered seismically quiet massive spike earthquake lately seismologist beginning amass evidence phenomenon related practise injecting oil gas drilling wastewater abandoned well combination humaninduced earthquake underground pipeline add element risk venture keystone stay tuned follow cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag concentrating solar crescent dune molten salt solar nevada solar pratt whitney solarreserve tina casey specialise military corporate sustainability advanced technology emerging material biofuel water wastewater issue tinas article reposted frequently reuter scientific american site view expressed own follow google related post ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2013/04/04/crescent-dunes-solar-thermal-plant-passes-another-milestone/","m_Places":["Tonopah, Nevada","United States","China","Nevada","Arizona","Arkansas","Meanwhile, Arkansas"],"m_People":["Tina Casey","Kevin Dooley","Jan Brewer"],"m_Companies":["Dunes","Obama Administration","Solarreserve","Pratt & Whitney","Exxon","Reuters","Scientific American","Twitter","Google"],"m_BiGrams":["crescent dune","fossil fuel","molten salt","solar energy","power plant","renewable energy","economic growth"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[12,6,5,4,4,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":506}
