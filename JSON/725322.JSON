It will use 4,000 acres of land and employ concentrating solar power. Molten salt will be the storage medium. Mitchell Dong, the company’s CEO explained the technology , “It’s a parabolic trough, or a ‘U’-shaped mirror that reflects or concentrates the sunlight by a factor of 100 to this thin tube of transfer fluid. In this case, it’s a synthetic oil heated to 800 degr","m_szDocBody":"world largest solar thermal plant planned arizona jake richardson mohave sun power company planning project mohave county begin
