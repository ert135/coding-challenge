cycle plant load follow conventional steam power plant electricity large fraction world wide supplied conventional steam power plant major fraction fed coal fired heavy oil petroleum coke natural gas pollution control increased cost addition green energy source grid increase capable control function power plant invention provide this due fast response turndown ratio standard steam power plant handle load problem load variability simply sufficient overcapacity utility past however large overcapacity expensive rarity today today overcapacity limited period low electricity demand night weekend control needed however period demand meanwhile storage steam reduce overcapacity needed control grid significantly cheaper alternative case boiler run full capacity time excess steam shifted turbine feed storage vessel however large conventional power plant superheated steam generated highpressure psi psi supercritical condition storage vessel pressure psi expensive solution this embodiment steam withdrawn storage reheater suitable lower pressure highpressure turbine generate electricity electricity needed period low demand embodiment steam expanded adiabatically reheat turbine stored steam practical steam needed load exceed maximum capacity point boiler fully utilised storage unit act boiler making steam needed special turbine stored steam sized system extra load short time result total output temporarily greater design capacity power plant method cost effective tool deal peak load load fluctuation allowing add shorttime extra capacity cheaper building coal power plant cheaper increasing bulk capacity power plant greater needed steady basis geothermal plant geothermal plant easily loadfollow but main cost geothermal electricity investment cost specific capacity redirecting reducing capacity control load result large economic loss storage invention overcome problem geothermal power plant system storing heat steam steam stored time low electricity demand therefore low electricity price electricity recovered storage electricity higher cost strong demand large saving storage invention cost kwh stored lower price differential low demand appreciated invention steam heat energy stored efficiency retrieved cost saving superheated steam stored efficiently reasonable cost invention solution good storing steam storing superheat temperature retrieving same invention solve number problem faced prior art power plant power industry invention enable storage solar energy enable power generation time solar energy available conventional power plant equipped heat storage capacity store heat offpeak time extra capacity peak time anytime load control grid fluctuation needed storage capability power plant provide improved control function grid well adding auxiliary turbine peak load capacity power plant extended normal capacity reducing additional power plant peak demand appreciated modification practised scope appended claim accordingly
