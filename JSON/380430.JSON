greg director director vico positive expectation building industry hopefully positive momentum year early early year jason ursaner cjs security inc jason ursaner cjs security slide showing leading edge capex increasing process step increasing lower yield bertrand year talked challenge increasing cost transistor obvious solution focus improving yield but guess wondering talk trend bearing cost time enduser versus industry expense margin bertrand loy well big important question jason answer obviously lot positioning player rightfully characterising stake growing industry player ecosystem feel good chance reason wenge described bringing lot yield enabling sery technology providing customer valuing demonstrated you put great position feel pain depend arguably equipment tool commoditized other pressure pricing other stay put name customer answer certainly start today jason ursaner cjs security inc okay followup stuart led market mentioned benefiting equipment side and guess wondering consumable unitdriven opportunity market change time move larger potentially larger diameter wafer make similar semiconductor business stuart tison right predominantly today business gas purification
