Kathleen M. Saul and John H. Perkins The major challenge of a green energy economy lies in finding “promising new technologies” that can replace fossil fuels. Thus, a major question arises, “Can we label nuclear power a promising new technology?” or “Is nuclear power ‘green’ and thus a valuable part of the technology portfolio that should replace fossil
