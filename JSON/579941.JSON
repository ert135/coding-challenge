The gas diffusion layer is manufactured by cutting a GDL material at a certain angle such that a machine direction of the inherent high stiffness of the GDL material is not in parallel with a major flow field direction of a bipolar plate to prevent the GDL intrusion into the channels of the bipolar plate without modifying an existing method for manufacturing the gas diffusion layer.
