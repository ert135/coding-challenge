contributor global carbon dioxide emission industry emit billion tonne carbon dioxide year total emission germany japan steel production simple rule thumb humanity make something highly half made china case steel fundamentally important material industrial civilization year china produced million tonne crude steel global total space single decade china producing world steel producing half comparison america equally striking china produced time steel america producing time more global carbon dioxide emission iron steel making obvious important consequence aluminium production china produce time aluminium america year change production ratio stark steel china produced alumnium america period american aluminium production declined chinas increased electricity generation modernisation equal electrification chinas electrification historically unprecedented chinas total electricity capacity increased gigawatt year adding generating capacity equivalent entire capacity german electricity grid contrast americas electricity generation barely budged increasing year america producing electricity china producing less rephrased china decade half build electricity capacity equivalent entire american grid chinas demand practically continue increasing couple decade significant future increase american energy consumption questionable energy consumption add china world biggest consumer energy remain long time contrast american energy consumption lower today decade ago chinas primary energy consumption increased single decade americas declined coal consumption hundred year ago cheapest generate electricity coal ground generate electricity steam turbine hundred year supposed technological innovation cheapest generate electricity coal ground generate electricity steam turbine rapid growth china powered wind solar nuclear fission natural gas oil powered fuel powered british industrial revolution coal machine involved blast furnace steam turbine cement kiln recognisable thomas edison challenge posed transition fossil fuel illustrated understandable preference rapidly developing country coal noone coal scale china today consume half world coal

longterm decline former increasing inexorably decade more highly likely decade china emit time carbon dioxide america future prospect started noting forecasting futile conclude form precise forecast future make illustrative statistical comparison put energy future america china context transition rational energy consumption american percapita energy consumption excessive statement provocative banal american consume time energy citizen germany japan france britain vaclav smil recently asked american live long consume energy european people smart average frenchman enjoy life average danish guy therefore rational american energy climate policy place reduction percapita energy consumption priority people prospect kind burden result unwillingness basic fact example carbon emission oil consumption americas transport system drastically reduced short period simply improving fuel efficiency transitioning diesel car fuel efficiency american car fleet essentially unchanged decade average american car heavy today fuel efficiency standard put place obama administration decade overdue fundemental necessity forget electric car driven millionaire priority american transport easy make transition driving vehicle real reason america transition european level percapita energy consumption evidence benefit excessive energy consumption limited evidence cost clear make transition china today versus britain chinas coal consumption peak inevitabe happen modernised country eventually transitioned coal yet timing shape eventual peak remain highly uncertain comparison britain historical percapita coal consumption revealing china consume half world coal percapita coal consumption unprecedented china consume tonne coal percapita basis however britain percapita coal consumption tonne time higher chinas today fact chinas percapita coal consumption lower today britain year ago therefore china see reason transition fuel coal growth over long transition britain coal sobering repeated china grave impact biosphere peaking britain percapita coal consumption largely plateaued half century prospect drastically china high armond cohen pointed practically china similar long plateau coal consumption made clear salient fact half chinas consumption generate electricity coal power plant long time coal power plant retired america today average year old chinas coal power plant built year china plan build coal power plant capacity highly chinas coal electricity generation significantly lower year now approximately chinas annual coal consumption half billion tonne coal produce steel prospect china producing billion tonne steel year consumption half billion tonne coal low nonexistent largescale coal production remain fundamentally dependent coal change soon coal stay china long
