Quora Sign In Nuclear Reactors Nuclear Energy Energy (physics) Politics of the United States of America The United States of America How many nuclear reactors would be required to power the United States? How much would each modern reactor cost to build, assuming there were no NIMBY issues (i.e. the land was available and we had the green light).
