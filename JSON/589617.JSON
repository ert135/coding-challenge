It's tough to tell what role fuel cells will play in the future of energy. Travis Hoium ( TMFFlushDraw ) Nov 22, 2015 at 9:14AM Fuel-cell vehicles are starting to roll off production lines. But will they ever overtake battery electric vehicles? Image source: ITM Power . For decades, hydrogen fuel cells have been a dream energy source, combining the abundance of hydrogen as an element with the clean conversion of it to and from a source of stored energy. But on a practical level, the technology has never really gone mainstream.Â  That","m_szDocBody":"hydrogen fuel cell big technological fad tough role fuel cell play future energy travis hoium
