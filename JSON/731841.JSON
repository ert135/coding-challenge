It is the only source of energy that can replace a significant part of the fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) which massively pollute the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect. If we want to be serious about climate change and the end of oil, we must promote","m_szDocBody":"benefit nuclear energy clean safe energy source capable ensuring continuation industrial civilization
