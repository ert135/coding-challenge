Show all posts Thursday, March 22, 2012 Energy finance in free markets: an open conundrum A question which has occurred to me lately revolves around the oft-heard objection that, \"Nuclear has always been a state enterprise.\" In other words, the high up-front capital cost (and attendant front-loaded risk from construction delays and potential intervenors) makes nuclear a tough pill to swallow for liberalized energy markets, despite the extremely low operating costs (and hence, low back-end risk). This problem seems to extend well beyond nuclear","m_szDocBody":"neutron economy showing post label smr show post thursday energy finance free market open conundrum question occurred revolve oftheard
