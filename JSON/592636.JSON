Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! Energy storage is a tricky subject, and yet immensely valuable in the long term, but only a few scientists are working on the topic in India. One of them is AK Shukla, distinguished professor at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore. He is now developing a hybrid supercapacitor, a device that can store electrical energy and has some advantages over the ","m_szDocBody":"iisc professor hybrid supercapacitor store electricity run electric car future hari pulakkat bureau aug ist special love visual aspect new enjoy exclusive slideshow treat energy storage tricky subject immensely valuable long term scientist working topic india shukla distinguished professor indian institute science iisc bangalore developing hybrid supercapacitor device store electrical energy advantage lead acid battery exhibit small prototype slightly bigger large matchbox weighing kilos hold charge light lamp hour market thirsting more lead acid battery invented long ago back year strong primary mean electricity storage india sustain growing market crore good biggest future application electric car grid storage big breakthrough electricity storage supercapacitor hybrid otherwise option tried charge supercapacitor faster lead acid battery shukla battery hold energy chemical change liquid change reversed drawing current capacitor physic chemistry store energy keeping mutually isolated metal plate equal opposite charge discharge plate connected supercapacitor work way hold tremendous amount charge capacitor charge quickly discharge quickly power needed battery charge slowly discharge slowly steady supply energy long period combining two scientist hope world provide energy power simple practise capacitor widely alternative battery good moment wait supercapacitor improve scientist option world storage device renewable energy require them moment solar wind energy supplement thermal hydroelectric power matter sun shine wind blow major supplier energy expected decade store energy source shut down good energy storage renewable energy big way good lead acid battery range emerging technology clear winner yet demonstration started happening now rahul walawalkar executive director indian storage alliance expect grid storage ramp supercapacitor good option day short burst power battery good too variety development pumping water hill option tried work mountain moment heating cooling taking heat needed work too alternative compressing air releasing pressure needed split water sun energy store hydrogen burning later technology developed grid storage problem sort cost energy policy tint legacy framed renewable energy storage mind technology regulatory policy feed other pramod kulkarni energy consultant worked california energy commission decade when policy take lead pushes technology reason happened power company greater policy consumer while consumer favour introducing energy storage grid generator oppose jay apt professor technology tepper school business carnegie mellon university introducing storage reduce profit generating company large scale profit small scale energy storage make microgrid iisc shukla contemplating building microgrid storage government agree proposal storage larger grid cost down technology improve indian lead acid battery manufacturer pushing product grid low cost achieved technology breakthrough made apt physicist astronaut energy researcher pick technology watch future startup carnegie mellon itself called aquion nontoxic material make battery resemble lithium ion battery cheap lead acid last long lead acid battery apt pick organic mega flow battery made earthabundant nontoxic material developed harvard professor michael azizin recent time flow battery extremely promising named liquid flow inside cell react electrode kind flow battery bulky cheap material scientist expect advance technology therby making suitable grid application competition lithium ion battery advanced significantly recent time cheaper safer emerging battery include made sodium magnesium new technology beginning commercial deployment landis kannberg lead energy storage programme pacific northwest national laboratory pnnl but proven large number year exciting watch technology make market stay top business new economic time app download now follow section latest new science ","m_szGeo1":"India","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/how-iisc-professors-hybrid-supercapacitor-can-store-electricity-run-electric-cars-in-future/articleshow/41224350.cms","m_Places":["India","Ak","Bangalore","California","Iisc, Ak"],"m_People":["Hari","Shukla","Walawalkar","Pramod Kulkarni","Jay Apt","Michael Aziz","Landis Kannberg"],"m_Companies":["Capacitors","Alliance","Energy Commission","School Of Business","Carnegie Mellon University","Some Technologies","Carnegie Mellon","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Economic Times"],"m_BiGrams":["lead acid","energy storage","acid battery","grid storage","renewable energy","flow battery"],"m_TriGrams":["lead acid battery"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[7,6,6,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[6],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":525}
