As of 2014, there were more than 65,000 megawatts of utility-scale wind power deployed across 39 states -- enough to generate electricity for more than 16 million households. This upswing, thanks in part to Energy Department efforts to improve the performance and lower the costs of wind power technolo","m_szDocBody":"home photos carbonfighting energy technology photos
