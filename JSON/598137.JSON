That is, a lot of people don’t think their cities or countries can achieve 100% renewable energy. However, a leading energy researcher at Stanford has led teams of researchers in order to practically show how 139 different countries could go 100% renewable. You can find the results of each of the plans right here . Based on research done by Stanford University, led by Mark Z. Jacobso","m_szDocBody":"solution project country hit renewable energy rogier van rooij idea hitting renewable energy yes energy electricity scare lot people lot people dont city country achieve
