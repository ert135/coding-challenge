More specifically, a system comprising a Storage Agent (S-agent) Cohort within a grid control society, wherein the system expands G and L intra-cohort protocols to allow the S-cohort to participate in power management of the grid by scheduling storage components in source or load roles as determined by the time-varying state of the power imbalance and by the risk-adjusting capacity margin
