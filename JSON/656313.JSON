Or, What I’ve Learned in 12 Years Writing about Energy (7000 words, about 25 minutes reading time) Folks who pay attention to energy and climate issues are regularly treated to two competing depictions of society’s energy options. * On one hand, the fossil fuel industry claims that its products deliver unique economic benefits, and that giving up coal, oil, and natural gas in favor of renewable energy sources like solar and wind will entail sacrifice and suffering ( this gives a flavor of t","m_szDocBody":"renewable future richard heinberg originally published post carbon institute
