Darshan Goswami |       May 28, 2014   By 2050, India could go 100% on Renewable Energy to create  a sustainable energy future. Courtesy: Solar Energy Bay In the coming years, India will face seemingly  insurmountable challenges to its economy, environment and energy security.  To  overcome these challenges India needs to shift to non-polluting sources of  energy.  As Jeremy Rifkin, an economist and activist, said in New Delhi in  January 2012,  \"India is the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy sources and, if  properly utilized, India can realize its place in","m_szDocBody":"india renewable darshan goswami india renewable energy create sustainable energy future courtesy solar energy bay coming year india face
