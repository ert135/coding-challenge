right ultimately extract oil fossil fuel financial political system together system expected fail run oil ground oil ground fossil fuel ground left ground view basing estimate future oil production oil reserve give indication respect actual future production absurd number resource number which higher reserve number make estimate future oil production coal natural gas production fall time oil problem financial political one resource ground problem direct application king hubbert theory incorrect king hubbert estimate future oil production based reserve amount importance notice estimate oil reserve estimate free flowing oil reserve type geologist thus restricted cheap extract reserve hubbert showed graph world oil production generally symmetric curve downslope mirror image upslope hubbert showed source energy supply nuclear early paper solar one rising level world oil production dropped talked making liquid fuel huge amount energy carbon dioxide waterin word reversing combustion order ramp nuclear solar level extremely cheap assumption king hubbert make effectively economy continue grow financial system hang together person today situation different alternate fuel supply economy continue grow fossil fuel consumption published reserve include large amount oil ground cheap extract type extracting oil impossible oil price low credit availability lacking tempting observer oil reserve assume well case basic issue future oil extraction future substitution uncertain basic iffiness reported reserve resource amount lot oil ground out require combination financial system high price producer adequate credit availability producer equity investment credit available buyer afford product political system happen citizen country oil extraction rioting lack food bank open country import oil adequate trade connexion country likewise substitution energy product overcome hurdle involved this cost hurdle higher ongoing cost substitute transition cost transition cost lot sunk cost lostfor example citizen forced quickly change gasoline powered car electric car resale gasoline powered car drop precipitously technology hurdle technology enable energy source cost substitute higher cost original energy source change substitute tend make economy shrink wage far citizen pay lot car electricity expensive citizen cut back discretionary expenditure cutback expenditure lead layoff discretionary sector make difficult government collect tax revenue basic issue wage dont rise oil energy price rise economist pay wage wage rise arbitrarily independently creating good service energy product unfortunately doesnt true practise based research oil price flat wage inflationadjusted term wage rise fast oil price instead wage tend rise oil price low making good service affordable part problem rising oil price radiate economy way higher food price oil produce transpire food higher metal price oil metal production higher finished product automobile home oil production wage rising sufficiently oil price rise worker cutback discretionary good result recession job layoff document oil supply limit continuing financial crisis published energy flip side wage rising fast cost oil extraction hard selling price oil rise provide adequate profit margin oil producer inadequate oil price oil producer current problem talk recent post what ahead lower oil price higher extractioncost beginning end oil company cut back onspending economist dont price remain low oil producer happen model supply demand correct world energy limit price temporarily rise again recession hit again back low price again basic issue diminishing return diminishing return occur take energy resource produce amount good case oil supply reach diminishing return company extract easytoextract oil first thus price oil rise oil produced cheaply gone obtain oil extract expensive extract oil diminishing return economy producing kind good service good service consumer wantssuch food fresh water transportation take consumer door door electronic good housing meet person need intermediate stuff making end product diminishing return society physical labour resource intermediate product leaving produce end product grow economy sense efficient producing final good service view major reason wage stop rising oil price rise energy price rise basic issue rate growth energy supply closely tied rate gdp growth energy make good service stand reason energy lead gdp growth economist dont necessarily agree connexion demandin word economy growing rapidly oil energy product support growth discuss steve kopit talk subject beginning end oil company cut back onspending obvious fact cheap energy supply easier ramp expensive energy supply cheap energy supply require investment good created cheap energy supply tend inexpensive making easier sell consumer competitive world market talk issue oil limit reduce gdp growth unwinding aproblem basic issue role debt long term debt play extremely important role economy consumer buy expensive good house automobile afford businesse invest project saved sufficient profit past project fund project government spend money tax dollar purchasing power prop price commodity oil metal making feasible extract them chance important role debt play debt crisis half year period price oil dropped briefly hitting barrel low range major bank

economy shift adding debt subtracting debt huge drop oil price similar drop oil price low range happen again clear federal reserve make price rise huge amount stimulus fewer option left oil price drop low level stay down large share oil production discontinued drilling done similar effect happen fossil fuel mining metal well drop oil production steepat steep soviet union collapsed oil production dropped year energy dropped rapidly well customer ukraine north korea steeper decline oil import basic issue government funding government surpluse economy greater surpluse government employee service mario giampietro researcher write specifically issue furthermore economy grow rising tax revenue make easy add programme service economy reaches diminishing return study past economy show inadequate government funding major bottleneck occur falling resource capita lead increasing disparity wage worker finding difficult goodpaying job government called provide programme precisely time ability

economic opposite credit card large balance pay back credit card debt adding debt increasing inability fund government programme reason expect financial governmental problem lead end current system diminishing return leading higher oil price moving escalator escalator doubtful reestablish widespread longterm debt collapse time economy shrinking person hear people talk rid fractional reserve banking system require growth maintain fact system helpful enabling extraction fossil fuel allowing economy metal concrete quantity availability bond financing helpful well essential part today economy long supply line complex product made supply world found credit crisis businesse both large small supply chain hit hard lack credit availability difficult solve solved faced making good locally smaller company shorter supply line system today support smaller world population lot peak oiler mezzanine viable economy similar today small amount expensive renewable continuing supply fossil fuel hard time happen problem likelihood fossil fuel supply decline quickly low price potential problem major cutback credit availability making transaction difficult governmental problem taxe fall short needed fund programme theory back escalator alternative fuel meet required specificationsvery cheap huge quantity expanding year year transformed liquid fuel similar oil nonpolluting now otherwise stuff today long last economy wont stop dime ability recycle longer use helpful placesolar panel people continue function especially offgrid grid continue while people lived local economy fossil fuel again live interesting time bob meinetz say gail oil industry public relation material day attempt conflate energy oil synonymous forward fossil fuel simply play smaller role energy
