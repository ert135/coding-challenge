AIP submarines are quieter While nuclear submarines have measures to reduce sound and magnetic signatures, nature of nuclear propulsion (steam turbine) makes them far more noisy than AIP submarine of same size. They also tend to be larger on a whole, making them even more detectable through either acoustic, i","m_szDocBody":"air independent propulsion sub half cost eliminate reason nuclear submarine air independent propulsion aip submarine fuel cell stirling engine battery liquid oxygen storage closed cycle diesel engine close cycle steam aip submarine quieter nuclear submarine measure reduce sound magnetic signature nature nuclear propulsion steam turbine make noisy aip submarine size tend larger whole making detectable acoustic infrared magnetic sensor weakness nuclear submarine cool nuclear reactor hot water dumped ocean leaving long trail submarine such detectable sensor size difference suggest nuclear submarine cruise speed knot compared knot aip sub combining slower cruise speed burst speed aip sub cover large area deny enemy nuclear submarine hdm mesma system aip sub submarine typically cost million usd quieter nuclear plant traditional diesel engine fuel cell large lithiumion battery pack liquid oxygen replace air combustion engine smxocean concept stay offshore deepwater operation day time aip system remain submerged day time range mile average speed knot submarine snorkling oxygen detected radar battery continue improve lithium ion battery soryu smxocean higher energy density lower cost success electric car telsa model increase advantage aip submarine gotland aip capable submarine nuclear submarine billion billion equivalent aip submarine half time cheaper nuclear submarine revival cost effectiveness year generation molten salt reactor available however reason economically militarily nuclear submarine nuclear submarine megawatt power compared megawatt diesel submarine power laser weapon system add unmanned submarine million each capable unmanned submarine year away unmanned system track submarine operate part pack working primary manned mothership submarine author ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://nextbigfuture.com/2015/04/new-air-independent-propulsion-subs.html","m_Places":["Us"],"m_People":[],"m_Companies":["Hdm","Diesel"],"m_BiGrams":["nuclear submarine","aip submarine","aip sub"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[9,5,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":243}
