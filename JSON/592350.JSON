That includes those involved in the intermediate product, the supercabattery or Asynchronous Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitor (AEDLC) with its higher energy density achieved in a compromise of other operational parameters intermediate between supercapacitors and batteries, notably the supercabattery called a lithium-ion capacitor.   Find out more at our next show Supercapacitors USA, Nov
