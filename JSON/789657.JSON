Thanks to cost-saving technologies and economies of scale, price can no longer be an excuse to invest in nuclear power rather than solar. In North Carolina, nuclear energy costs 16 cents per kilowatt hour (the energy required to run 10 100-watt light bulbs for an hour), whereas solar is now going for 14 cents per kWh — a rate
