A bypass connects between the input of a DC/DC converter and the output thereof, and therefore supplies power generated by the fuel cell to an inverter, bypassing the DC/DC converter. A changeover switch selectively changes the connection of the output of the fuel cell between the connection to the input of the DC/DC converter and the connection to the bypass.
