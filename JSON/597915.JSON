The vast technological progress that has been made since the invention of the computer chip in the mid-20th century can be simply told in one observation. Moore's Law claims that every couple of years, the number of transistors - the switches whose \"on\" or \"off\" functions are the building blocks of computing - that can fit on a chip doubles. Paired with other technology improvements, this has meant processors doubling in power every 18 months.
