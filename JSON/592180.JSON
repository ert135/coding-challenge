That material would be molybdenum disulfide, and a research team from Rice University has just announced a new energy storage breakthrough based around the sponge-like characteristics of the three-layered edge. We’re going to drop the h-word up front, as in hydrogen for fuel cells , because the Rice team also foresees an application in hydrogen production. But first let’s check out the energy storage angle.
