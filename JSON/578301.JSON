Brief Description of Related Technology [0006] Batteries are important energy storage devices used for military and commercial applications. While these devices can have energy densities exceeding 100 Wh/kg, this energy is difficult to fully access in pulsed and high power applications due to the relatively slow kinetics associated with the redox processes of batteries. [0007] Supercapacitors are a class of electrochemical energy-storage devices that could complement batteries for load-leveling or uninterruptible power supply applications.
