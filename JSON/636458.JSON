In every endeavor, there has to be a first: The first person in space, the first man on the moon, the first to stand atop the highest mountain in the world. For Germany’s offshore wind industry, it was the pioneering Alpha Ventus installation off the coast of Borkum that waded first into the water. Now, nearly five years after the blades of Alpha Ventus’ turbines began turning and producing electricity via drivetrains from ABB, the verdict over its initial operations is ","m_szDocBody":"alpha
