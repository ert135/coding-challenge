Taking a ride in a Tesla usually leads to the desire to take home a Tesla. But with the Model S sedan starting at $70,000 and the Model X CUV/SUV starting at $80,000, the market for these cars is fairly limited. At the end of this month, Tesla Motors will unveil the much-hyped Model 3 sedan. And although we haven’t gotten a look at it yet (its design is a closely guarded secret), we know enough to suggest th","m_szDocBody":"reason tesla model huge success chris boylan now tesla motor
