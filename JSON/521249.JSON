raise government revenue taxing wage gasoline shown complement leisure people drive arent working mean gas tax help undo disincentive work caused taxing wage economist sarah west rob william findthat crosselasticity largeenough matter practise increase week great step direction question let join pigou club support higher gasoline diesel taxe gasoline price lowest level year economy turning corner great time put significant tax increase lucas calculate total cost car transport system human freight cost road city highway including environmental cost due noise gase smell particulate matter etc include cost illnesse hospital etc lifelong cost invalid due accident and factor changing person happy life invalid life already good calculation guess car transport system subsidised system have post comment lucas agree miss important cost major cost killing effect particulate matter people living busy highway city centre take year life study car fuel tax raise fuel tax tax imply people drive slower public transport more safe electric bicycle often etc heavy traffic injury disabled air pollution healthy people general tax vat income tax schalk cloete say taxing consumption production realistic achieved practise large part reason customary tax revenue production income simple taxing consumption externality playing large role complexity quickly start mount gasoline complexity named example obvious congestion accident externality vary greatly region another implying fair system track driving order put fair number tax return naturally possible example externality related type consumption named interesting health effect related excessive consumption unhealthy foodstuff usa spend dollar turned economy health care stupendous amount money achieve lowest life expectancy developed world most massive expenditure technically avoided healthier consumption habit japan healthcare expenditure relative gdp half average life expectancy full year longer potential postive economic impact fixing externality dwarf achieved gasoline taxe happen due long list obvious complexity related form taxation overall worth internalise shortterm local externality congestion air pollution people experience negative effect externality the people benefit causing them demand change cost begin excessively outweigh benefit taxed longterm global externality where negative externality separated experience thousand mile ten year obvious politically sensitive example named excessive fertility bill excessive selfdestructive consumption example post comment robert bernal say gas tax direct cdr advanced nuclear energy required power cdr scale remove excess gas tax based income period make harder based taxe pay money back like lot money end year perhap credit electric car paid smart card put poor afford pay afford buy awesome electric car drive older vehicle afford electric truck make battery cheaper well therefore tax oil company bit compensate tax excess proceed other rebate poor better extracting olivine enhanced weathering mineral sequestration development advanced nuclear required desalinate vast amount water green desert soil sequestration and biofuel clean energy technology based capacity factor lower capacity factor storage required industry subsidy deal that gas tax direct cdr reliable energy source advanced machine automation technology required electric car battery price earth lucas congestion excessive production symptom root cause suppress symptom ignoring root harm good allowing underlying problem continue unchecked root problem excess fertility billion people spaceship earth stabilised level large environmental problem people produced children source problem people produced children part solution man woman children pay penalty parent children taxe lobby excess fertility tax child child etc recommendation simply government huge source cash flow fritter politically correct project eliminate root problem money longer pocket hop gegangen say put tax gas people switch evs negative externality congestion accident mileage tax cafe standard pushing fleet mileage higher pennsylvania raised gas tax gallon revenue coming maintain road gas tax applied rural areas impose larger relative burden rural areas generally congestion issue this sort carbon tax account ruralurban divergence politically acceptable system skewed
