Weâ€™ve been reporting on hydrogen fuel cell cars and the recent developments surrounding the various technologies behind the alternative fuel for some time now. From cost-cutting breakthroughs in the catalysts that help generate power to the removal of carbon monoxide from the energy conversion process , hydrogen is making big leaps forward as an energy source. But will it ever make to the mainstream? As I looked back at all the gains hydrogen has made this year, I realized the technology still seemed distant, immaterial and problematic.
