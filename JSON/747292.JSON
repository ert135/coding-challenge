As is clear from the title, this is another project to use wind energy in times where demand can’t keep up with supply to make some hydrogen from water. That is the future for storage of surplus renewable energy, since the existing infrastructure can store massive amounts of hydrogen gas. The German existing gas infrastructure  could handle storage of up to 200 TWh , which is much more than the a","m_szDocBody":"germany open hybrid wind power plant tweet excellent energiewende germany
