(TSX.V:ALP, OTCQX:ABGPF ) in Coosa County, Alabama. Located in a past-producing region of the state known as the Alabama Graphite Belt, the Coosa project is approximately 50 miles south-southeast of Birmingham and 20 miles north of Montgomery. The project is also 30 miles northeast of the Bama Mine project, also owned by Alabama Graphite Corp. (AGC).
