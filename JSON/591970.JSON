Though we can’t exactly drink our way our way out of the effects of rising sea levels, drawing more potable water from the ocean would provide a critical boost to the world’s water resources at a time of rising heat, drought, and human demand. Energy Efficient Desalination Currently, the desalination method of choice is a process called reverse osmosis.
