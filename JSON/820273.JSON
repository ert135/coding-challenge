Actually, it did so just a few hours ago. \"An impression of the cooling towers of the proposed new nuclear build at oldbury. Impression made with the help of a photograph of cooling towers by Christopher Peterson, www.christopherpeterson.com.\" The British nuclear power plant, which had been running for 44 years, shut down at about 11:00 GMT (or 6:00 am EST) today. The area may not be without nuclear power for too long, though. Another nuclear power plant is planned for a site nearby — ","m_szDocBody":"zachary shahan today world oldest nuclear power plant shut down actually hour ago impression cooling tower proposed nuclear
