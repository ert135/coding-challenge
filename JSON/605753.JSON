We're now in 2016, and there are tens of hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and fully electric cars to choose from most mainstream carmakers. Heck, the fastest road cars from Ferrari, Porsche and McLaren are hybrids, so people no longer look at you like at a weird hippie whenever you mention the w","m_szDocBody":"hybrid plugin electric car
