Compressed air storage is another technology that is generally about 10 times smaller in capacity than hydro, much more expensive and requires large sealed underground caverns, which are rare. Although battery systems are, at most, 1Â per cent of the capacity of typical pumped hydro and an order of magnitude more expensive, many dispersed batteries in residences, commercial premises and
