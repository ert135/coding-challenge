To smooth out these curves and irregularities, grid-scale storage is a key diffusing element, spreading the renewables love across a wider range of hours throughout the day. Grid-scale batteries are typically looked to as the solution for grid-scale energ","m_szDocBody":"biocat hope solve grid storage kyle field renewable grid world peak load peak production curve shift
