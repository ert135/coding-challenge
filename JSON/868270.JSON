The year was 2005, and it was former Governor Arnold Schwartzenegger, who, with his hydrogen-fueled Hummer, put his name and reputation behind developing a “hydrogen highway.” In the ensuing years, however, enthusiasm for hydrogen-powered transportation fell out of favor; unavailable fueling stations, slowed research and development and pressure from the fossil fuel industry in fear of “stranded
