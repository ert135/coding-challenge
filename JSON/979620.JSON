rim tyre combination tyre pressure indicator provided side mirror assembly horn chirp similar momentary sounding car horn flashing turn signal lamp mean provide signal operator temperature compensated pressure return nominal ambient temperature pressure return desired set point mean vehicle operator concerned absolute pressure value effect temperature algorithm continuous monitoring adjustment pressure warning initiated temperature compensation made thus setting system input manufacturer recommended pressure nominal temperature tyre vehicle system require wheel position training action slight inflation deflation tyre sequence taken tyre condition indication require systemactive status low pressure condition present input wheel position identification provide system receiver local wheel vehicle instance located wheel well system require wheel position training step above economic reason however single omnidirectional receiver typically used however practical combine tyre monitoring system directional antennae central location antenna responsive transmission source left hand side vehicle responsive transmission source rear front vehicle combination antennae response economic determination triangulation algorithm wheel transmitter position local antennae avoiding position training step retraining tyre rotation allowing automatic identification wheel type front rear passengerside driverside individual wireless broadcast tyre pressure data received central controller broadcast from autosensing tyre pressure system that automatically identify wheel vehicle received wireless signal broadcast distinguish that example tyre sensor broadcasting located rear driver side wheel wheel advantage preferably autosensing tyre pressure system include spaced antennae
