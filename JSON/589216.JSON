Compared to conventional vehicles, fuel cell powered vehicles generate zero greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants at point-of-use. In addition, they can greatly reduce global dependence on gasoline, which may be exhausted in the near future. With the development of fuel cell technology, fuel cell electric vehicles are more than twice as efficient as internal combustion engines,","m_szDocBody":"hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle nick verde llc massachusett usa concept fuel cell electric vehicle fcevs promoted year compared conventional vehicle fuel cell powered vehicle generate greenhouse gas emission air pollutant pointofuse addition greatly reduce global dependence gasoline exhausted future development fuel cell technology fuel cell electric vehicle efficient internal combustion engine promise equivalent durability refuelling range mile fewer part fewer moving part great feature leave lot imagination fcevs wait obstacle overcome path bright future fuel cell problem onboard hydrogen storage unlike gasoline hydrogen gaseous form suitable storing large amount normal pressure temperature therefore solution applying pressure psi bar compress hydrogen gas sealed tank compression system unavoidably heavy large costeffective solution term solution reducing temperature liquefy hydrogen hydrogen densest liquid solution hydrogen storage gaseous storage pressure however issue remain method hydrogen boiloff energy requirement hydrogen liquefaction cost cryogenic tank recently hydrogen adsorption solid material promising solution effective hydrogen storage system based technology potential small lightweight prove solution long term daimler presented research fuel cell electric vehicle mercedesbenz utilising metalorganic framework mof technology store hydrogen technology build metalbased porous structure efficiently hydrogen needed research area ongoing replace highpressure hydrogen storage year what problem aha refuel fuel cell car one extensive system deliver gasoline refinery local filling station hydrogen facility system constructed producing transporting dispensing hydrogen consumer currently hydrogen station excluding private station located california buy fuel cell electric vehicle hydrogen station nearby therefore conveniently deliver hydrogen consumer big challenge fcev commercialisation idea home hydrogen station prompted alternative solution home hydrogen station generate hydrogen natural gas water electrolysis solar wind power designed provide heat electricity home supply hydrogen fuel hydrogen powered vehicle approach support hydrogen supply vehicle reduce emission household natural gas emission reduced compared average household gasolineengine car commercial electricity heat now company honda ballard power system verde llc etc focusing designing constructing homesized hydrogen generation station simplicity use increasing popularity public private hydrogen station fuel cell electric vehicle widely world main issue related fcevs limitation vehicle cost fuel cell durability reliability public acceptance etc however development technology problem solved example cost fuel cell system vehicle reduced reaching department energy cost goal fuel cell durable reliable utilising modified catalyst reported radoslav adzic brookhaven national laboratory public shown initial concern safety fuel cell electric vehicle fact safe gasolinepowered car take time public accept technology based discussion reasonable predict year fuel cell electric vehicle finally replace conventional vehicle main ground transportation technology outlandish dream airplane ship powered fuel cell industrial revolution happening now based braintree massachusett verde llc design deploy residential commercial industrialscale electrolyser renewable energy storage industrial processing transportation fuel natural gas plant peaking cooling fertiliser manufacture distributed generation company subsidiary angstrom advanced product operation world extensive network national laboratory partner university posted steve barrett ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.renewableenergyfocususa.com/blog/2013/9/19/hydrogen-for-fuel-cell-electric-vehicles/1006.aspx","m_Places":["Massachusetts","Usa","Aha","California","Braintree, Massachusetts"],"m_People":["Honda","Radoslav Adzic","Steve Barrett"],"m_Companies":["Verde Llc","Path","Mercedes-benz","Ballard Power Systems","Us Department Of Energy","Brookhaven National Laboratory","Angstrom Advanced Inc"],"m_BiGrams":["fuel cell","cell electric","electric vehicle","hydrogen station","hydrogen storage","hydrogen fuel","verde llc","natural gas"],"m_TriGrams":["fuel cell electric","cell electric vehicle"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[17,9,9,5,4,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[9,9],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":458}
