November 13th, 2008 by Ariel Schwartz   I remember seeing the movie Chain Reaction back in 1996 and praying that nuclear fusion would become a reality in my lifetime. And according to researchers at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (LLNL) in California, it just might. At the facility’s National Ignition Facility (NIF), researchers are gearing up to test the potentially unlimited power source. The NIF has almost finished construction on the world’s largest laser. After its completion in March 2009, researchers will start to prepare for fusion ignition.
