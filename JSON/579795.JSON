The motor control system can dynamically adapt to the vehicle's operating conditions (starting, accelerating, turning, braking, cruising at high speeds) and other inputs and parameters. That consistently provides better performance. Isolating the vehicle's motor or generator electromagnetic circuits allows effective control of more independent parameters.
