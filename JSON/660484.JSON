talk important operational goal finish guidance current year bernd bernd schulte you martin start talking aix qualification processe number led producer making progress led market difficult customer pressing priority qualifying production equipment keeping committed qualify market challenging environment recall announcement december reached agreement chinese customer sanan optoelectronic substantial reduction volume aix mocvd system ordered delivered effort made party achieved milestone early technical team party concluded customer specific qualification requirement defined milestone met sufficiently agreed sanan continue existing partnership cooperating future system generation system application partnership include activity area semiconductor expected play significant role chinas upcoming year plan forward remain committed building leadership position manufacturing technology led oled power electronic silicon semiconductor carbon nanomaterial continue investing r&d focused product orientated way convinced strategy aixtron forward furthermore focus cost reduction product efficiency improvement areas operation now give market serve starting led market demand led chip grown anticipated market research institute time production capacity increased driven governmental subsidy programme fact resulted comparatively low utilisation rate led producer prevailing overcapacity absorbed meaningful market driven demand capacity return notwithstanding potential strategic capacity investment long run expect select capacity expansion strategic investment combined replacement activity productive equipment system latest generation providing significant higher productivity short term visibility leddriven capacity demand remain low diversification strategy goal year continue drive market gallium nitride led progress made space martin before important focus aixtron wide bandgap material gallium nitride silicon carbide power electronic application electronic device based material significantly energy efficient established siliconbased technology important application electric car power inverter converter few customer areas including leading player coming quarter growth opportunity aix planetary system increasing number power device manufacturer transition product development pilot production phase additionally initial demand foundry closely development china plan strengthen semiconductor industry including power electronic growth opportunity oled display lighting application gained traction market year including receiving order optacap

goetzeler basically discussed couple time conference call difference silicon industry led industry difference structural impact forward industry lately kristen owen industry great then lastly could touched bit question gross margin talk relief material sourcing side martin goetzeler basically mentioned report management report part set small team design cost project purchasing working technology order solution supplier order reduce material cost base process started year middle process continue push initial result end year kristen owen okay great colour operator question srini sundar summit research question please srini sundar taking call question veeco market share north term mocvd comment question percentage aixtron revenue nonmocvd application year martin goetzeler okay question all competitor mentioning number primarily refer gan led application here talk mocvd call gan led market call nongan led market basically covering power electronic power optoelectronic areas solar laser future also application move call process production therefore call nongan led part couple quarter really very strongly defended position sometime quarter quarter improved market share nongan led part wait announcement indiscernible part split identify change company split sale mocvd other today bit difficult predict gave broad revenue range make key statement today difficult side say year split basically continue push hard order diversify portfolio silicon oled diversify areas power electronic mocvd optoelectronic mocvc depend end market addressing srini sundar much operator question malte schaumann warburg research question please malte schaumann optoelectronic business increased significantly elaborate sustainability area expect eur million revenue forward solar laser application risk revenue forward area martin goetzeler question very strong year area couple order unexpected easy ladder say continue diversify portfolio drive power electronic business order organic continue qualify customer qxp business year focus continue application talked about successful malte schaumann okay risk drop between martin goetzeler generally detailed number difficult predict hope expectation said long year happened malte schaumann okay final question potential replacement market coming mocvd led assess potential risk device customer turn competing system market make investment decision based higher productivity tool martin goetzeler yeah concerned device earlier generation tool right opportunity customer situation utilisation rate highest tool switch tool highest running cost output typically tool earlier generation generation opportunity industry unique tool offer solution customer provide higher productivity complete written equipment forward opportunity quantify opportunity difficult business plan forward plan level replacement business bernd mentioned related uncompetitiveness older generation malte schaumann ","m_szGeo1":"United
