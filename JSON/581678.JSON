Background of the prior art [0004] The ratio of gasoline to oxygen at the time of ignition is called the stoichiometeric mixture. This stoichiometric mixture is ideally set to a ratio of 14.7 to 1. The ECU accomplishes this by monitoring several key elements, fundamental to all combustion engines, i.e. exhaust gas temperature, exhaust oxygen levels, throttle position, rpm's, torque, power requirements, engine temperature, manifold absolute pressure (MAP), outside air temperature and humidity, as well as other factors. The computer (ECU) listens for engine Knock, and adjusts the engine ignit","m_szDocBody":"background prior art ratio gasoline oxygen time ignition called stoichiometeric mixture stoichiometric mixture
