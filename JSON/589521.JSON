Two of Japan's biggest automakers are about to make sizable wagers on a different kind of clean fuel tech: hydrogen power. Toyota will launch the $57,500 Mirai fuel cell vehicle (FCV, above) next year , while hydrogen veteran Honda will out a model in 2016 . But wait, aren't EVs the last word in green cars? Fuel cell cars are EVs, in a way, but you can fill one up with hydrogen in five minutes rather than waiting hours for a charge. The only way to do that in an electric vehicle (EV) is by swapp","m_szDocBody":"hydrogen fuel cell vehicle share save damn torpedoe and teslas japan biggest automaker make sizable wager kind clean
