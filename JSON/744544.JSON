The inventor himself made that claim on his blog on December 26, 2015. “Here is the big news: yes, the E-Cat X produces directly electric power,” Rossi wrote to a correspondent named James Watt. “We are working to harness and make it work.” What this means is that the E-Cat X works more like a fuel cell th","m_szDocBody":"lenr cold fusion new cold fusion energy lenr new rossi ecat produce electricity directly published jennifer tweet latest version andrea rossis ecat low energy nuclear reaction lenr device produce electricity mechanical mean inventor made blog big new yes ecat produce directly electric power rossi wrote correspondent named jame watt working harness make work mean ecat work fuel cell generator electricity made generator engine turbine turn generator make electricity fuel cell car toyota mirai electricity produced directly electrochemical reaction exciting new greatly reduce size cost complexity device device reactor make heat steam turbine make electricity device lower production cost maintenance cost wrong hydrogen powered toyota mirai mean easier adapt lenr device powering train automobile lenr device place battery electric car tesla hydrogenpowered fuel cell vehicle mirai replace pollutiongenerating diesel engine railroad locomotive make make train efficient longer carry fuel electric train powerline infrastructure make cheaper easier construct highspeed rail line powerline make system vulnerable weather natural disaster system failure blackout sabotage current generation electric train germany ice require power line operation power home businesse industrial equipment agricultural equipment earthmoving machine mining machine construction machine weapon system military ship aircraft including drone helicopter robot space probe lot dont including amount electricity generate cost operation coefficient power cop size device amount fuel burn potential problem heat fuel cell run hot lenr researcher including russias alexander parkhomov duplicate ecat ability make electricity year parkohomov revealed duplication rossis device hot ecat world rossi make evidence verifying public researcher ascertain practical effect duplicated harnessed fantastic statement andrea rossi related search ","m_szGeo1":"Germany","m_szSourceType":"source_general","m_szSrcUrl":"http://coldfusion3.com/blog/rossi-yes-the-e-cat-x-produces-electricity-directly","m_Places":["Most","Toyota","Tesla","Germany","Russian Federation"],"m_People":["Andrea Rossi","James Watt","Alexander G.
