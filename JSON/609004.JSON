While the Quantino may be quite a sleek-looking electric vehicle, it’s the flow cell technology that supplies power to the electric motors, that’s truly noteworthy. To elaborate, the nanoFlowcell is unlike a lithium-ion battery or lead-acid cell, which stores direct current – it’s an electrolyte-fuelled flow cell vehicle, in that it stores liquid electrolytes instead to generate electricity (like a hydrogen fuel cell","m_szDocBody":"nanoflowcell quantino electrolyte lowvoltage sitting quant geneva redesigned nanoflowcell quantino sit company quant range quantino sleeklooking electric vehicle flow cell technology supply power electric motor noteworthy elaborate nanoflowcell unlike lithiumion battery leadacid cell store direct current electrolytefuelled flow cell vehicle store liquid electrolyte generate electricity like hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fluid nonflammable nontoxic produce emission inexpensive fuelling charging car similar petroldriven vehicle electrolyte liquid stored separate tank positive charge negative charge special membrane divide mixing this ion exchange take place see generation electric current receiving electrolytegenerated current electric motor total motor produce torque company second hit top speed nanoflowcell claim quantino full tank litre electrolyte liquid meanwhile quantino possesse lowvoltage system translate number benefit include long travel range impressive propulsion mentioned additionally highvoltage system electric vehicle require protection contact flash shock this however unnecessary lowvoltage system design quantino flow silhoutte expresse flow cell technology front vehicle sport fullled headlamp lowslung bumper illuminated quantino logo door allelectric drive dragoptimised body generate wind noise too lending muscular stance set inch wheel also quantino low centre gravity electrolyte tank centre vehicle balanced axleload distribution agile handling moreover hot gase emitted vehicle underbody covered cladding reduce form drag inside quantino sport sensorflow technology similar quant capacitive switches centre console furthermore noise absorbing insulating material contribute exceptionally quiet drive drive unit generate sound quantino making debut geneva standard configuration nanoflowcell produce quantino small batch feasibility study carried year provide basis final decision filed ","m_szGeo1":"","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://paultan.org/2016/03/04/nanoflowcell-quantino-an-electrolyte-low-voltage-ev/","m_Places":["Geneva"],"m_People":["Quant F"],"m_Companies":[],"m_BiGrams":["flow cell"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":238}
