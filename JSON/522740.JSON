How Fast a Transition from Oil? Like it? 5 Posted May 10, 2010 Keywords: Natural Gas , bp , deepwater horizon , electric vehicles , gulf of mexico , offshore drilling , oil , transportation , wall street journal The Gulf Coast oil spill remains the top energy story this week, eclipsing a $10 drop in oil prices that should soon ripple through to gas pumps near you. With BP's latest effort to contain the spill having run afoul of a slush buildup composed of methane hydrate crystals, the deepwater well continues to leak at an undetermined rate.
