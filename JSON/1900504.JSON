The method includes generating and transmitting input commands to the robot from a remote station. The remote station may include a personal computer that is operated by a doctor. The input commands can move the robot so that a video image and sounds of the patient can be captured by a robot camera and microphone, respectively, and transmitted back to the remote station. The robot may also have a monitor and","m_szDocBody":"apparatus method patient rounding remote controlled robot united state patent abstract method remotely monitoring patient method include
