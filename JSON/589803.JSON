However, despite of all that talk, these days Toyota unveiled the first widely-available commercial hydrogen fuel cell vehicle hybrid, the Toyota Mirai. I have nothing against hydrogen itself or the hydrogen cars currently produced – it’s clean, burning it produces water and it’s the ideal solution for our oil-hungry transportation system.
