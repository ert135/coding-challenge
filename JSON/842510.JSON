The motion may be provided either by wheels or propellers driven by rotary motors, or in the case of tracked vehicles, by linear motors . The energy used to propel the vehicle may be obtained from several sources: from chemical energy stored on the vehicle in on-board batteries: Battery electric vehicle (BEV) from both an on-board
