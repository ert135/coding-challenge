John Beltz Snyder A group of Danish teens are turning abandoned bicycles into vegetable gardens. Conceived by Cherie Hornsleth, Oskar Vedel, and Ciliane Stubkjær, and carried out with the help of youth volunteers, the Cykelhaver project turned the derelict bikes into a two-month exposition in Aarhus, Denmark . Decked out with herb boxes, the bikes are home to tiny gardens of parsley, rosemary, thyme, mint, strawberries, and other edible plants as well","m_szDocBody":"recharge wrapup dlr fuel cell plane vws
