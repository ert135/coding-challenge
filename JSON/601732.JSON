But this short flight was the first by an aircraft wholly powered by solid hydrogen. The experimental drone runs on pellets that emit only water vapour when they burn. The drone’s fuel is also three times as light as a comparable lithium battery . One day the technology could help make commercial aircraft lighter and cleaner. “The idea was simple: stick solid state hydrogen fuel into a drone and","m_szDocBody":"flight hydrogenpowered drone water vapour exhaust flying hydrogen sam lasted minute guy woolly hat highvis jacket looked drone enthusiast short flight aircraft wholly powered solid hydrogen experimental drone run pellet emit water vapour burn drone fuel time light comparable lithium battery day technology make commercial aircraft lighter cleaner idea simple stick solid state hydrogen fuel drone fly tricky phil anderson head marine technology scottish marine science argyll flight place hydrogen fuelcell car eclipsed electric vehicle idea aircraft either previous effort cryoplane project airbus large tank liquid hydrogen superlow temperature tank proved big cumbersome practical storing hydrogen pressurised gas efficient advertisement drone system designed firm cella solid pellet packed cartridge centimetresquared pellet made chemical compound produce steady stream hydrogen gently heated gas converted electricity fuel cell run drone rotor inclusion polymer stop compound melting help release hydrogen lower temperature test flight lasted minute flew altitude metre hour fuel board anderson unlike battery put fuel far preparing takeoff sam anderson think future version drone perfect environmental climate monitoring team carry arctic north atlantic lighter batterypowered drone fly longer cleaner main produce water vapour anderson lot science trace gase contamination drone first plane drone propeller moving part susceptible effect called carburettor icing prevent petrol drone operating extreme cold say hope hydrogen drone carrying research science couple year but tantalisingly technology drone longer term city car eventually provide hydrogen power commercial aircraft anderson say step agree cella managing director stephen bennington cella working french aviation firm safran produce pelletpowered fuel cell produce auxiliary power plane inflight entertainment galley lighting version technology highpower application dispense cartridge altogether millimetresized pellet pumped liquid fuel claim bigger commercial space drone missy cumming human autonomy lab duke university north carolina real answer step topic ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076536-first-flight-of-hydrogen-powered-drone-with-water-vapour-exhaust/","m_Places":["Uk","North Atlantic","North Carolina"],"m_People":["Sams","Cella","Stephen Bennington","Safran","Missy Cummings"],"m_Companies":["First Flight","Marine Technology","Airbus","Storing","Humans","Duke University"],"m_BiGrams":["water vapour"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":285}
