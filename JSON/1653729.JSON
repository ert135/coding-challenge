The closer to the end user a function or firm is, the further downstream it is said to be. Raw material extraction or production are elements of the supply chain considered to be upstream. The oil and gas supply chain is commonly referenced in this manner. The upstream companies identify oil and natural gas deposits and engage in the extraction of these resources from underground.
