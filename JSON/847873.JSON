What happened? October 27, 2010 Sponsored by At the edge of the massive excavation project that is a preliminary step to building Americaâ€™s biggest nuclear power plant, Joshua Elkins stands next to two holes that span 42 acres in the red Georgia clay. Elkins maintains the earth-moving equipment that dug these holes, each as big as 15 football fields, 90 feet down to bedrock and then painstakingly refilled them to about 50 feet with soil tested to
