A vast majority of car makers offer at least one hybrid model, and the number of electric cars on the market grows annually. However, hydrogen technology is still lagging behind because it’s plagued by an array of setbacks, including an underdeveloped infrastructure. Digital Trends sat down with Merten Jung, BMW’s head of fuel cell development, to get insight on where the technology stands today, what will change in the coming years, and when we can expect to see

developed moved weve completely stopped project made sense time component costeffective technically speaking possible fuel cell technology made progress year combust hydrogen anymore additionally hydrogen stored tank liquid today hydrogen drivetrain hydrogen gaseous cool low temperature store tank sery programme nonetheless helped bmw gather precious information hydrogen learned lot hypothetically sery equipped hydrogen drivetrain heavier dieselpowered model yes reason technology improvement reduce cost reduce weight increase power experimental sery significantly heavier internal
