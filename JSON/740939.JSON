Located on Isla Colón in Panama, the village will consist of 120 houses and a lodge on 83 acres of tropical jungle. The first two-bedroom home was built late last year, and is made from 10,000 plastic bottles pulled from Panama trashcans, roadsides, and beaches. The walls of the homes consist of steel cages filled with bottles and then encased in a concrete mix.
