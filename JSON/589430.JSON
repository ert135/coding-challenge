These defects include high first cost, high fueling cost (compared to both gasoline and electricity), lack of fueling stations and lack of a nationwide fuel-delivery infrastructure â€” especially for renewable hydrogen. It would take several miracles to ove","m_szDocBody":"tesla trump toyota part big problem hydrogen fuel cell vehicle credit shutterstock tweet comment biggest problem hydrogen fuel cell vehicle face
