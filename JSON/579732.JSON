Description of the Related Art [0005] The amount of energy a battery can store per unit volume is presently increasing by about 8% a year. Yet, the needs of ever more powerful electronic devices are increasing at a rate more than three times that amount. One way to obtain energy is to âharvestâ energy from the environment by converting heat, wind, light or vibrations that occur naturally. For example, sensors in a skyscraper could generate energy by sensing the normal sway of the skyscraper. Certain materials are âpiezoelectricâ, i.e., they naturally become deformed by heat or vibra","m_szDocBody":"description related art amount energy battery store unit volume presently increasing
