By Karl Lenz The report by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy on the first couple of solar project auctions  notes on page 6 an estimate of about 25,500 hectares of real estate used for ground-based large scale solar projects in Germany. That’s 255 square kilometers. Germany’s total area is 357,168 square kilometers . So those 255 square kilometers add up to a whopping 0.07 percent of Germany’s total area.
