But this reactor, called Watts Bar Unit 2—one of two near Spring City, Tennessee—isn’t quite new. Most of it was built in the 1970s and ’80s alongside Unit 1, which came online in 1996 and has performed flawlessly. The two reactors are essentially identical in terms of safety, technology, and output. But there’s been one major advance in the 20 years separating their openings: widespread acceptance of fossil fuels’ role in climate change, and the urgent need to wean the economy from it.","m_szDocBody":"ipad reply year nuclear power reactor open time decade reactor called watt bar unit one spring city tennesseeisnt new built alongside unit cameonline performed flawlessly reactor
