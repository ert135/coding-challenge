That global solar PV installations are pushing so hard and fast towards the 200 GW mark is of no real surprise given recent analyst predictions for countries such as China and Japan. The Q4’14 figures are nevertheless impressive, amounting to the energy supplied by five large-scale nuclear powe","m_szDocBody":"global solar installation pushing joshua hill global solar installation
