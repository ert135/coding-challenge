Contents 6 See also History Energy storage as a natural process is billions of years old - the energy produced in the initial creation of the Universe has been stored in stars such as our Sun , and is now being used by humans directly (e.g. through solar cells ) or indirectly (e.g. by growing crops).  As a purposeful activity, energy storage has certainly existed since pre-history, though it was o","m_szDocBody":"powerpediaenergy storage jump navigation energy storage power storage storing form
