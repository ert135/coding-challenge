Helen Knight reports It can be hard to imagine after the travails of a typically blustery winter, but the wind does not always blow in the UK. This means the country’s increasing number of wind turbines, which provided 11 per cent of our electricity supply in 2015, are not always spinning at times of peak demand. Conversely, the wind often blows at night, when demand is low. This can make life very diffi","m_szDocBody":"breathing life hydroelectric mature technology hydro promising solution uks energystorage problem helen knight report hard imagine travail typically
