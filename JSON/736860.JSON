These plants, less than 300 megawatts in size, are \"small\" only when compared to a conventional nuclear reactor or full size (1000 MW) fossil fuel plant. The nuclear industry hopes that factory-built SMRs will eliminate construction delays and quality control issues that have plagued nuclear projects such as EDF's Flamanville and Olkiluoto.
