Hydrogen is a chemical element (H) and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of 1.00794 u, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Hydrogen is the simplest element . An atom of hydrogen consists of only one proton and one electron. Itâ€™s also the most plentiful element in the universe.
