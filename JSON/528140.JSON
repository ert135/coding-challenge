dumped greenhouse gase atmosphere before yet effort save climate continue unabated failed already failure course degree however discontinuous mind stand subtlety arbitrary line success failure drawn stick them physical difference ppm small psychological difference immense yet believe successfully atmospheric carbon dioxide level part million you pint beer climate scientist admit longer possible suspect diet coke prospect keeping atmospheric carbon dioxide level ppm essentially zero obvious reality publicly acknowledge shown way however implication important discussed work led steve davis university stanford committed emission term committed emission easily understood analogy wishes lower coffee intake recently supermarket bought bag stuff committing drinking amount coffee future hand person coffee lying house easily avoid coffee something make easy fossil fuel decade germany developed lauded renewable energy programme however period built huge number coal power plant total opened half decade history reliable guide assume plant year load factor therefore building plant germany committed emitting billion tonne carbon dioxide atmosphere plant lifetime built nuclear power plant committed tonne carbon dioxide however past mistake easily undone last long coal power plant car gas furnace last decade however bought replace life over run simple thought experiment immediately stopped building fossil fuel infrastructure infrastructure green emit carbon dioxide simply existing fossil fuel infrastructure long have honda civic replaced electric car buy car gas furnace heating home replaced heat pump life over coal power plant economical run replaced lowcarbon plant put mildly wildly optimistic scenario revealing one fortunately number estimated scenario paper published science year ago steve davis median estimate existing fossil fuel infrastructure result atmospheric carbon dioxide level increasing ppm today level ppm this course completely implausible scenario incessant hype surrounding tesla moving electric car tomorrow else instead slightly credible scenario emission peak decade stop building fossil fuel infrastructure again optimistic nuclear energy significant growth decade currently wind solar energy barely represent tenth annual growth global primary energy consumption coal coal consumption making highest proportion energy consumption growth decade wildly optimistic yes close ppm atmospheric carbon dioxide level increased average ppm year year decade ppm committed emission push ppm hopeful scenario building fossil fuel infrastructure decade now however simply credible scientist renewable energy achievable short order however airport sit boeing whisk world inevitable green future fly plane kerosene building sit mass reinforced

ship transport electronic gadget asia western consumer china stop making blast furnace producing steel large section fossil fuel economy remain largely unchanged year decade come committed emission fact viable substitute fossil fuel make clear keeping atmospheric carbon dioxide level ppm implausible concluded simple back envelope analysis underlying reality done worryingly politician incapable delivering suboptimal european burning coal power plant burning natural gas american easily reduce personal energy consumption impact quality life appear politically incorrect proposition meanwhile germany shut nuclear power plant building coal power plant applauded people supposedly care protecting climate easy cheap cut carbon emission simply left table untouched possibility politician
