natural gas electricity generation shortterm emission reduction ddpp analysis show natural gas current technology reduction make big investment natural gas power plant shortterm locked path headed failure imply market force enough put price carbon important step sit back watch magic market work cheapest easiest marketdriven path shortterm emission reduction sufficient longerterm saving limit global average temperature rise degree celsius aggressive climate target mean successful implementation depend directed technological change technological change propelled organised sustained funded effort engaging government academia business targeted technological outcome mind ddpp country preliminary report released earlier year word research development demonstration deployment initiative informed analyse report electrify electrify electrify scenarios require cleaning electricity supply moving renewable energy nuclear power fossil power plant carbon capture storage electricity possible analysis show electricity generation approximately double carbon intensity reduced percent current level mean electric space water heating building electrified transportation through plugin electric vehicle car truck running hydrogen produced electricity scenarios limited fossil fuel natural gas oil reserved activity extremely hard electrify including industrial processe heavy duty vehicle energy efficiency required cost low energy efficiency cornerstone scenarios affordable deep decarbonization require highlyefficient home building equipment appliance transportation industrial processe analysis start annual energy outlook projection efficiency add areas assumption appropriately aggressive end lighting model move led technology assumption potential building performance improvement see based past experience conservative good new better give additional breathing room reach emission reduction target world kind analysis required start imagining detail path forward choose path path
