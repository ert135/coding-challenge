The substrate may be used as battery separator or in other industrial applications. The polymeric porous substrate is formed from a polymer such as a polyimide or polyetherimide that, in the absence of porous particles, forms a skin when cast into a substrate. The polymeric porous substrate also includes porous particles. Claims  (OCR text may contain errors) WHAT IS CLAIMED: 1.
