In an even more pointed jab, he referred to the fuel cell as the \"fool cell.\"      Musk shared a friendly handshake with Toyota President Akio Toyoda in Palo Alto, California, in May 2010, when Toyota announced it would invest $50 million (about 4.5 billion yen at the time) in joint development of a new electric vehicle with Tesla.      ","m_szDocBody":"close tesla ceo elon musk year musk
