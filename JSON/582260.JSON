Cell tabs can be made of a material that is sufficiently thick enough to be able to carry several times the current of other tabs. The tabs are notched to engage an interconnecting member where the notching is performed in the same stage as making individual cell tab bends. Once the cell tabs are notched and bent, they are then positioned together such that the notched portions lie on","m_szDocBody":"method joining multiple parallel tab multiple cell tab effectively
