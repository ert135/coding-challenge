(Credit: Screenshot from YouTube) Researchers from Stanford University have built a battery that does everything you wish your cell phone’s lithium-ion battery could. The team announced its aluminum-ion battery prototype Monday in the journal Nature , and it’s a glimmer of hope for every thumb-pounding smartphone addict. The battery can fully charge in about one minute, hold a charge longer than conventional batteries and is safer than lithium-ion batteries.

dont but basic understanding understand battery now pretending theyre aluminium battery long lasting output quick recharging exciting world standard hopefully afford them captain slog congratulation aluminium battery brilliant development wait fir standard battery construction aluminium thing aluminium british word ignorant american believe continuously childishly rebel british dont forget british dont stupid grow back aluminium battery stupid but time brilliant battery exciting hope huge success future imagine bank powering transport home connected solar cell wind generator time battery run down quickly recharged full power car bus power put back hill motor generator havent battery said greatest success cell developed lithium ion now watches hearing aid torches padd phone etc aaa cell etc good work ailurophile praise ridicule american sentence denigrate aluminium versus aluminium excessive incorrect capitalization betray you simply spell pronounce word differently make stupid captain slog okay fair enough you david read that but turned wrong dont youve told sorry other tend ridicule american praise time aye sort make america bit bipolar hand youre praising lord

soon bloody hell smegging exciting smallbusinessman electric car regenerative braking charge battery dont fast charge battery that captain slog term that anyway statement essential regenerative braking battery charged car youre referring battery age recharge reason quick charge cell dont okay wont needed recharge time idle hill but feature kick voltage low kick automatically then solar power great buse large roof area course theyd employ kind creature like base covered reject wont day but wont feature disengage continue plug station home smallbusinessman regenerative breaking important electric car today important future battery quick charged all time reuse energy extending range vehicle youre instal anyway battery low captain slog said glad way installed set way you mentioned kick demand power low kiod standard battery out advantage you kiod transport feel never constantly refuelled recharged paua people having fun there paua abalone great delicacy sound like smallbusinessman dont agree shouldnt kick power low kick time braking increase mileage charge wont youre suggesting percent most reason all conversion electrical kinetic power vice versa efficient accelerating braking net loss power additionally town energy spent maintaining speed drain battery true climbing descending steep hill youll lose energy hill gain coming back down regenerative braking require fast charge battery charge battery slower rate current charging station fast recharge battery here bottom line range increased faster recharge battery increased assuming rest vehicle remain same additional capacity fast charge battery big benefit charging station francis wisely pointed out captain slog guess what youre this not agree point thinking morning its est write kiod time thinking morning was manual override disabled reason typical human forget enable charge back whinging car charging blaming stupidity transport designed amazing feature put important kiod regenerative braking interesting discussion started wee argument aired sorted out good bad point made relevant point hicup gradually fall place said engineer scientist expert but cringe love stuff exciting but now aluminium battery embryo stage let grow know result exceed arguing about catch surprise standard electric bill drive there thousand now number growing rapidly amused comment remembering pretty gross misunderstanding evs work regen the common term regenerative braking used etc regen typically turning off begin driving battery charge replaced time brake pedal lift foot accelerator slow stop you replacing charge lost couple exceptional circumstance replace energy produce regen imagine live hill leave house headed downhill generating energy battery store situation bms battery management system automatically route power produced regen large heavy duty resistor heat bit wasting excess energy charge battery full also driving long steep hill point generate energy completely replace charge lost begin burning waste heat part downhill roll case action bms automatic seamless requiring action part evs lever button increase regenerative braking effect people prefer strong regen effect remove foot accelerator pedal prefer effect engine powered car mentioned idle evs dont idle motor continue turn car moving opposed experience internal combustion engine ice recently continued run and waste gasoline idling year ice car begun special system engine turn red light saving bit gasoline hybrid turn engine normal operation efficient taking age recharge typically problem youre driving unusually long distance typically morning drop kid school stop market laundry work whatever everything done drive back home spend couple second plugging forget car morning unplug handle daily driving again its than spend couple minute couple day standing smelly gasoline pump tank full pay fuel electricity production car regen pointless drive back production evs tesla leaf impatient wait removed ice engine gas tank catalytic converter muffler created conversion ran motor capable providing regen range drive single charge bit today refined motor question regen deciding slow stop integral farther single charge captain slog electric bill make valid point totally agree you but engaging disengaging satisfy panel member objected reason told standard didnt disengage wanted telling everyone scientist expert this basic understanding mind ahead future thinking required transport transport thinking once wasnt our transport repulsor lift technology long time star war made live spec ship have feature incorporated main computer heart ship individual power supply shield defence life support communication transporter replicator general electric drive etc power power supply generator reason clear goe dont put egg basket power ship operation blow power supply dont ship huge power generator taking lot room dont understand power supply are repulsor lift technology work but sure theyre now making good progress battery moment development stage doubt late time year most exciting battery everyone know way pace technology advancing day have remember made valid point excessive power fast charging battery full thinking dream ship excessive charge wondering case main power supply power appropriate required mean kind great emergency occur but wed feature ship design standard standard technology understand
