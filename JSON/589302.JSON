A fuel cell is a type of technology that is more efficient at generating electrical energy from fuel sources such as natural gas and hydrogen.Â This makes the technology more economical and beneficial to use, especially in a climate where energy resources are becoming harder to recover, making energy generation more expensive. \"As a low carbon and efficient energy s","m_szDocBody":"korea agreement
