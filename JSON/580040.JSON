Recovery is enabled by a recovery enable flag (25) upon conditions such as vehicle using (22) low or no power (16), vehicle speed at or near zero (22), electric storage SOC above a threshold (23), and no recovery (19) during the last half-hour (or other duration). The recovery restart resets a timer (79) to ensure (19) that recovery is not attempted too of","m_szDocBody":"inservice fuel cell performance recovery performance fuel cell power plant decay electric
