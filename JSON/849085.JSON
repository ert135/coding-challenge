Several years ago I read about small modular nuclear power plants.  I think the size was about 50K?  They were to use tennis ball-sized carbon fiber fuel pellets.  A standard design and small size were intended to reduce the high design, building costs and construction time. 318 Views • Upvoted by Stephen Frantz , Worked in nuclear energy for a few decades, with the US Navy, Westinghouse, Independent Consultant,… Define \"plans\"?
