In Indonesia, since indigenous people and other rural communities rarely have formal land rights, palm oil companies have taken over large tracts of customary right lands and community forest, which traditionally provide a livelihood to 40 million people. Such developments often lead to numerous, persistent and often violent conflicts between local communities and companies.
