The 110MW Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Plant, located near the town of Tonopah in the Nevada desert, will be the largest solar tower plant with integrated energy storage facility built to date. But what exactly is it? What does storage actually do? And how does it work? Let’s start with the tower.  There are a bunch of different technologies that come under the umbrella of solar thermal, or concentrated solar power. These include compact linear Fresnel reflectors, and parabolic troughs. Solar towers use heliostats (or dual-axis sun-tracking mirrors) to reflect th","m_szDocBody":"integrated solar work crescent dune solar energy plant located town tonopah nevada desert largest solar
