A long list of challenges must also be overcome to achieve the benefits promised by autonomous driving.  If these challenges are overcome, it is possible that autonomous technology counter-intuitively reduces city driving demand by making car-free lifestyles more attractive.  Introduction Ful","m_szDocBody":"future personal mobility vision part autonomous vehicle highlight total benefit autonomous
