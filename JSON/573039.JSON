This layer is non-porous, conducting only lithium ions during operation, and may be structurally free-standing. Alternatively, the layer can be used as a battery electrode in a lithium-ion battery, wherein on the side not exposed to battery electrolyte, a chemical compound is used to regenerate the discharged electrode.
