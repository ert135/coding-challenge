The media eats it up, and the debate for and against hydrogen resurfaces again. Proponents claim hydrogen will someday   free us from our dependence on oil and eliminate pollution   from our cars. Cynics say hydrogen may never be practical   as a motor fuel, and they accuse energy companies and automakers   of focusing on hydrogen at the expense of more realistic,   near-term solutions.
