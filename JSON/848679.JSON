Answer Wiki 491 Views it depends. Aside from the usual differences in the price of raw material and labor in different countries there are different specific laws regarding nuclear reactors in different countries and different reactor designs Some of these laws are needed. Some are not. For example, in some countries laws mandate safety measures which might be necessary for some older designs of reactor but are not needed for newer safer designs.
