A baseline for the set of activities is determined. An actor's performance of any one of the set of activities is monitored in order to determine information about how the user performed the set of activities. A quantification (e.g. estimation) is made of the carbon conservation by the actor by comparing the information against parameters ","m_szDocBody":"system method enabling carbon credit reward select
