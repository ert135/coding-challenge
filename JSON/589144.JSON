Capable of an overnight refill of fuel cell electric vehicles it is designed to be a single, integrated unit that will fit in the user's garage. Honda's next generation Solar Hydrogen Station, though not as big as the previous systems , will still produce enough hydrogen (0.5kg) via an eight-hour overnight fill for daily commuting (10,000 miles per year) for a fuel cell electric vehicle","m_szDocBody":"hondas gen solarpowered hydrogen fuel cell station home image gallery image honda begun work smaller solar hydrogen station prototype intended home refuelling appliance capable overnight refill fuel cell electric vehicle designed single integrated unit fit user garage hondas generation solar hydrogen station big previous system produce hydrogen eighthour overnight fill daily commuting mile year fuel cell electric vehicle company previous solar hydrogen station system required bulky electrolyzer separate compressor unit create pressure hydrogen compressor largest expensive component reduced system efficiency creating differential pressure electrolyzer honda engineer eliminate compressor world home system innovation reduce size key component make station world compact system improving system efficiency percent value calculated based simulation compared solar hydrogen station system replace make unit palatable motorist smallersized garage apartment dweller shared parking facility designed work conjunction hondas fcx clarity vehicle charging station compatible smart grid energy system honda solar hydrogen station enable user refill vehicle overnight requirement hydrogen storage lower emission expensive offpeak electrical power honda daytime peak power time solar hydrogen station export renewable electricity grid providing cost benefit customer remaining energy neutral engineered eighthour slow fill overnight refilling fuel cell electric vehicle homeuse solar hydrogen station replenish hydrogen typical daily driving meeting commuting requirement driver previous generation system honda hydrogen purity station meet highest sae iso specification solar power installed los angele centre honda r&d americas solar hydrogen station employ identical honda soltec panel solar array powered previous system array utilise thin film solar cell composed copper indium gallium selenium cig key strategy hondas creation solar hydrogen station homeuse create lifestyle convenient clean energyefficient sustainable home refuelling addressing refuelling infrastructure advance wider fuel cell electric vehicle consumer honda hope combination fuel cell electric vehicle solar hydrogen station lead establishment hydrogen based renewable energy resulting major reduction emission greater energy sustainability word testing schedule availability historically speaking honda began operation solar hydrogen station los angele centre honda r&d americas creation threeunit system hydrogen storage july year honda working twounit system original honda electrolyzer solar array utilising prototype honda cig solar cell offered improved system efficiency solar array fitted mass production cig cell honda soltec reduced size array percent improved photo voltaic energy efficiency now singleunit station begin operation improving world system efficiency increasing efficiency percent value calculated based simulation compared previous solar hydrogen station system world highest system efficiency current research taking place los angele centre honda r&d americas inc ","m_szGeo1":"","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.gizmag.com/honda-solar-hydrogen-fuel-cell-refueller-electric-vehicle/14049/","m_Places":["Los Angeles Center","Americas","Americas, Inc."],"m_People":["Fcx Clarity","Sae","Iso","Honda R"],"m_Companies":["Honda","Power Times","First Solar","Americas, Inc."],"m_BiGrams":["solar hydrogen","hydrogen station","fuel cell","cell electric","electric vehicle","system efficiency","station system","los angele","angele centre","centre honda","honda r&d","r&d americas","solar array"],"m_TriGrams":["solar hydrogen station","fuel cell electric","cell electric vehicle","hydrogen station system","los angele centre","angele centre honda","centre honda r&d","honda r&d americas"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[12,12,6,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[12,5,5,3,3,3,3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":394}
