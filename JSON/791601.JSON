Hide Our headline could be answered several ways, but with regard to cars, the answer is “yes,” electricity is environmentally cleaner when energizing electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids compared to gasoline or diesel choices. This however really says a lot about the high efficiency of batteries driving electric motors, because as government and advocacy groups have observed, production of electricity still pollutes the soil, water and air, including with greenhouse gases. But even with a U.S. grid that recent estimates say utilizes coal for 37 percent o","m_szDocBody":"electricity clean energy source hide headline answered way regard car answer yes electricity
