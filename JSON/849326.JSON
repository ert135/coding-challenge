In the short term, hybrid and full electric vehicles will substantially increase the demand for base-load power from grid systems. The use of hydrogen in the production of transport fuels from crude oil is increasing rapidly, and is vital where tar sands are the oil source. Nuclear energy can be used to make hydrogen electrolytically, and in the future high-temperature reactors are likely to be used to make it thermochem","m_szDocBody":"transport hydrogen economy updated
