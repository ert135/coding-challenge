Something remarkable is taking place that is bound to lead to a deep reshaping of the energy debate, starting in Europe and North America. It used to be the visionaries and the NGOs who talked about a 100 % renewable future, but now leading number-crunchers and energy experts are joining the chorus. I","m_szDocBody":"study renewable
