No. Nuclear and solar energy are each adequate for the next billion years.  That's right; billion not just million or thousand. Bernard Cohen published the facts about that. This page assumes the law of conservation of energy.  If you don't understand that, look at law of conservation of energy. Here's how you can tell if you don't understand.  Several times I have received in email the following idea for powering cars with hydrogen from water.  Run the car on hydrogen obtained by splitting water by electrolysis using the car's gene","m_szDocBody":"energy question world running energy nuclear solar energy adequate billion year right billion
