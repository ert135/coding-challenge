Demand will exceed supply. It seems to me that this view is backwardâ€“the decline in supply will come through low oil prices. The oil glut we are experiencing now reflects a worldwide affordability crisis. Because of a lack of affordability, demand is depressed.

diminishing return reach limit take increased resource usually physical resource human labour produce type product oil product subject diminishing return metal kind increasingly expensive extract part world shortage water make unusual technique desalination long distance pipeline obtain adequate supply higher cost pollution control similar effect diminishing return product pollution issue graph cost production resource subject diminishing reserve result similar shown expect cost extraction energy supply rise finite supply deplete diminishing return cost increase tend small long time suddenly turn corner oil shift higher cost move conventional oil unconventional oil metal shift quality ore depleted move mine require moving great deal dirt extract quantity metal water steep rise diminishing return well longer provide sufficient quantity water extraordinary measure desalination obtain water time cost increase diminishing return minor generally compensate small cost increase technological improvement efficiency gain system thus small amount diminishing return hidden system effect diminishing return greater harder hide cost increase cost finished product kind for example food gasoline house automobile start rising relative income worker worker cut back discretionary expenditure order money cover expense diminishing return affect economy way diminishing return adversely affect economy lower wage ability borrow squeezing sector economy reason lower wage relate fact that cost producing commodity rise worker sense productive example calculate wage worker unit oil oil expensive extract this wage worker unit oil produced amount shown similar chart hold resource difficult extract cost production higher greater pollution control example expect wage coal worker falling well also shift higher cost type energy increasingly inefficient energy production based analysis united state solar energy worker coal miner coal solar energythe large number worker required produce solar

elise gould educated worker declining wage major affecting affordability debt saturation affordability favourably affected rising debtfor example lot easier buy car house wouldbe purchaser obtain loan debt level stay fall problemfewer good purchased government reaching limit borrowing capacity adding debt remain historic debt gdp ratios debt saturation occur relate young people student loan expensive borrow money car homefurthermore fact wage keeping price increase worker reduce borrowing ability worker lagging wage true student loan involved mentioned above fact inefficient sector tend squeeze portion economy gobbling disproportionate share worker resource resource doesnt produce lot good traditional sensea desalination plant expensive amount water produced dollar investment large extent cost inefficient sector passed consumer consumer cut back discretionary spending cutback spending squeeze discretionary spending leading cutback discretionary sector reduced employment overall author effect diminishing return economy wishful thinking economist back diminishing return started major problem economist created model economy react higher cost energy production symptom diminishing return view cost oil extraction rise oil price rise match higher cost alternatively substitution place technological greater efficiency customer cut back cost product somehow place adverse impact economy unfortunately model dont correspond practiceat long take inexpensive energy produce good worker afford higher priced energy work regard feedback reflected economic model reduce wage debt making harder buy good requiring moreexpensive energy product furthermore price commodity oil rise country oil energy mix handicapped trade country oil energy mix example country depend tourism which depend oil use revenue greece find difficult customer oil price high lack revenue lead financial problem country networked economy work price commodity rise longterm rise while consumer government borrow more attempt continue business usual ultimately though situation work customer afford buy home car wage rising inflation adjusted term government collect tax revenue dealing lack ofaffordability bring system downnot priced scenario imagined many decline low price glut oil supply direction commodity price rise again clear rise again lot easier commodity price rise problem simply inadequate price commodity leading lack commodity problem inadequate demand crude oil coal lng iron ore problem greaterespecially wage lagging robert bernal say material matter pipe desalination solar wind especially kind nuclear dense power source avoid diminishing return conventional diffuse source flirt with incure additional supporting job insurance real estate resturant electric car and home battery weed job material insurance etc job displaced corporation allowed and now economically required produce good overseas require supporting job thing insurance and thing made away material displaced job real problem congress put stop exception made part completed here afford nuclear then say diminishing return good job point view physical limit efficiently produced
