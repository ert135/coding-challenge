It’s the kind of infrastructure you’d drive by a thousand times without noticing, like a hot water heater or an air conditioning unit. And compared to the gleaming metal maze of wine-making machinery next to it—air compressors, hoists, bins—the installation isn’t flashy. But the cabinets and their contents are part of an experiment that made headlines around the world this year. Behind the unmarked doors are enormous batteries.
