December 27, 2014 by NRDC Switchboard 13 Comments Merrian Borgeson, Senior Scientist, Energy and Transportation, San Francisco A new analysis lays out several detailed “pathways” to a low-carbon future for the United States, and offers practical guidance for policy makers. The bottom line finding is that there are multiple ways we can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with known technologies and with an incremental cost equivalent to less than 1 percent of gross domestic product.
