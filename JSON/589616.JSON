Vaunted as the first mass-produced fuel cell vehicle to go on mainstream sale, it costs £53,105. That figure’s helped by part-funding from the European HyFive project, a hydrogen fuel consortium of which Hyundai’s a member, which cuts around £15,000 from the price. Without taking that into account, the ix35 Fuel Cell would cost £67,985. Hmm. That’s quite a lot of money for a Hyundai!
