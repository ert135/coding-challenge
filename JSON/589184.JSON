The only sounds it makes are snatches of Vivaldi from the stereo, and the exhaust pipe emits nothing more noxious than water vapour. As it passes, a cloud of butterflies takes flight into the clean summer air.   Proponents of hydrogen-powered vehicles have long envisioned this as the future of motoring. But today, that dream is almost as distant as ever – and increasingly serves as a distraction in the quest to cut greenhouse gas emissions by replacing petrol.   At first glance, hydrogen looks like a ","m_szDocBody":"mark peplow sleek car glide past undulating hedgerow country lane sound make snatches vivaldi stereo exhaust pipe emit noxious water vapour passe cloud butterfly take flight clean summer air proponent hydrogenpowered vehicle long envisioned future motoring today dream distant increasingly serve distraction quest cut greenhouse gas emission replacing petrol glance hydrogen suitable alternative higher energy density mass petrol distributed filling station pipeline specially designed internal combustion engine burn hydrogen directly hydrogen efficient drive fuel cell generate electricity decade ago government funding agency drew ambitious plan develop cheaper fuel cell enable car store practicable quantity hydrogen president george bush committed million research effort clear hydrogen quick fix energy secretary steven chu diverted funding battery research move hydrogen economy concept coined early advocate electrochemist john bockris expected cheap plentiful nuclear power produce hydrogen electrolysing water hydrogen energy carrier made sense time powerline losse made hydrogen efficient move energy long distance battery technology simply wasnt good propel electric vehicle faster milk float nuclear accident extremely rare made government wary investing extra nuclear power station exposed hidden cost nuclear power cleaning accident dealing radioactive waste instead world hydrogen produced fossil fuel steam reforming natural gas example produce carbon dioxide carbon dioxide sequestered underground isnt carbon capture storage technology sufficiently developed cost astronomical cleaning wind solar power drive electrolysis plant isnt clean electricity feed today efficient power grid charge lithiumion battery outstrip fuelling point batterypowered car simple extension existing power grid technology reducing recharging time hydrogen contrast require supply infrastructure hydrogen car road was recently honda fcx clarity dozen drive southern california place sufficient network hydrogen filling station february hyundai launched tucson hydrogen fuel cell vehicle hope make european market compare european commission hydrogen roadmap forecast incredible million hydrogen fuel cell vehicle storing hydrogen board car require expensive pressure vessel cryogenic system chemist engineer worked hard alternative adsorbing hydrogen porous material hydrogendense molecule release hydrogen demand example matthias beller university rostock germany recently unveiled ruthenium catalyst generate hydrogen methanol mild ruthenium catalyst lovely bit chemistry breakthrough hydrogen economy reaction release carbon dioxide harder capture million car single power station catalyst turnover frequency reached order magnitude practicability rely ruthenium global stock thought tonne blind optimism february ukhmobility partnership issued report suggesting million hydrogenpowered vehicle road optimistic report noted effort reduce carbon dioxide emission million tonne world emit hour hydrogen undoubtedly transport niches talk hydrogen powering substantial proportion planet billion car and counting driven technooptimism evidence faster significant impact improving battery technology investing clean electricity source developing carbon sequestration hydrogen economy alluring distraction important task decarbonising transport system ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2013/03/hydrogen-economy-clean-energy","m_Places":["California","Tucson","Rostock","Germany","Uk"],"m_People":["Mark Peplow","George Bush","Steven Chu","Fcx Clarity","Matthias Beller"],"m_Companies":["Honda","Hyundai","European Commission","Storing","Rostock"],"m_BiGrams":["fuel cell","carbon dioxide","hydrogen economy","nuclear power"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[4,4,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":421}
