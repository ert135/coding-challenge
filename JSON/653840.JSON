They're expensive to run and emit pollution and greenhouse gases. Even people who don't rely entirely on generators use Australia's power grid, which is mostly fuelled by polluting, climate-altering coal. Now, one company is showing that supplying Australia's energy needn't be expensive or polluting. AllGrid Energy produces 10 kilowatt-hour solar-power batteries that take advantage of Australia's abundant sunlight and growing demand for solar panels.
