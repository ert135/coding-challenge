We here at CleanTechnica have remained conspicuously quiet on the topic of nuclear energy over the past couple o","m_szDocBody":"thought nuclear zachary shahan fact nuclear order prove nuclear good bad vice versa bad good yes provide article point matter nuclear energy dont needed fact adequately weigh nuclear energy cost benefit did impossible put nuclear good category cleantechnica remained
