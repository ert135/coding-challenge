A single pulse width modulation controller (PWM) is possible for the present invention for not only start-up but also normal boost modes. A primary circuit can have a clamping switch or at least two choke diodes. The choke diode can include “push-pull” and “L”-type configurations. A resistor can be used to dissipate energy clamped from the voltage spike.
