A new road map from the Danish government suggests how By Climatewire on October 1, 2010 Credit: Â© David Biello Advertisement COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark could become one of the first countries in the world to completely stop using oil, gas and coal by 2050 if it boosts wind production by as much as six times and hikes taxes on fossil fuels tenfold, a government-appointed commission said. Denmark should increase its wind power capacity to between 10,000 and 18,500 megawatts in 2050 -- most of it by installing offshore turbines -","m_szDocBody":"scientific american denmark fossil fuel
