Description of Problem Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are becoming increasingly integrated in new technologies, especially within the clean energy, military, and consumer electronics sectors. As each of these sectors continues to grow, so does the industry's demand for the constituent REEs. While exact projections of demand in future years are difficult to make, analysts have placed the lower and upper bounds for annual growth for total REE demand at 5% and 9% over the next 25 years
