Charles Shults III combines solar hot water panels with a large fresnel lens to flash the hot water to steam, which runs a turbine to generate 6 kW of electricity, with hot water left over, which is recycled through the system. The system is expected to cost around $6,000 - $8,000 USD (targeting $1/Watt), with an ROI of 3-5 years.
