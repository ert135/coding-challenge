Hyundai released a zero-emission fuel cell vehicle (FCV) this year, and Toyota is slated to release one in 2015. The last time Grist wrote about FCVs was back in 2009, and the prognosis wasn’t optimistic. Has anything changed? Is the cost and greenhouse gas output of producing hydrogen more detrimental than having a zero-emissions car? (I do live in Southern California, where conceivably there will be hydrogen refueling stations.) Garrett C. Tustin, Calif. A.
