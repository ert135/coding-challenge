energy institute david sandalow doe christof rhl chief economist note recorder pick introduction panel see biography detail panellist introduction session adam microphone weve lost bit time session running bit over make minute worth slide abandon isnt great hear panellist now adam sieminski chief energy economist deutsche bank dont intimidate you civil engineer and that wanted make economist panel ill introducing bit introductory remark wanted make simple topic today discussion energy economy looking perspective energy demand make simplified conceptual attack energy demand function thing population capita income energy intensity energy demand function dollar gdp world population growing pretty rapidly growth projection united nation census bureau global population slow down growing year billion people planet now and lot energy projection set close billion people population growing wanted round number youd capita income average growth capita income globally year lot nation policy reducing population growth rate virtually country globe seek achieve faster capita income growth yes capita income growth earn right down capita income appreciably year population growing capita income growing energy intensity good new standpoint energy resource energy intensity economy amount energy needed grow gdp falling longterm growth rate minus figure falling lot study suggest that effort part technological development government mandate improve minus mean mean energy demand general grow population capita income growing faster ability improvement energy intensity efficiency down huge number country brazil india china mexico russia capita income low oil consumption capita china half gallon day person achieve rate oil consumption what happened south korea taiwan asia lower rate country europe oil demand china factor possibly order magnitude now china burning million barrel day mean china theory income similar example million barrel day now venture likelihood supply million barrel day china current total global worldwide consumption running million barrel day huge change right slow population growth lot capita income grow happen country brazil china india well what possibility well global recession early and fact business cycle timing long fed keeping low interest rate talked meeting fed start raise interest rate end year august trigger economic slowdown possibly globally end interested knowing recession coming shortest expansion cycle weve had right okay oil price low argue back oil play role global economic downturn had steve brown talk bit oil role economic outlook turn year oil accounted global gdp oil price closer half back global gdp range oil absorbing global gdp priced high consumer sense afford begin trigger downturn demand global gdp producer afford barrel needed create problem sweet spot yes global gdp equivalent barrel back rate early half oil predict oil price going oil barrel trouble again okay comment turn panellist wont needing those booth steve brown slide running briefly now youve heard today bios small booklet steve nonresident fellow resource future serve codirector rff centre energy economic policy joining rff year steve year career federal reserve bank dallas director energy economic microeconomic public policy work instrumental building reputation dallas fed excellent work energy economic steve please you steve you adam pleasure here you watching presentation earlier today sort thinking well cover cover cut interest speed cut minimise disagreement realised that end day say ahead originally planned say chart kind history oil price basically world war shown combination blue red red highlighting jim hamilton work idea oil price risen sharply grey bar show timing recession including current recession combination jim hamilton number year ago say post world war recession preceded sharply rising oil price now fact post world war recession preceded sharply rising oil price price adjusted inflation theyre real though know wouldnt attribute recession current recession sharply rising oil process nonetheless sharply rising oil price prior recession rise inverse relationship oil price economic activity adam talked opposite view fact presenter shortterm outlook talking about complex relationship oil price economic activity research put together inverse relationship characteristic oil supply shark disruption oil supply pushes price oil characteristicthat oil supply shark reduce amount oil economy slow economic activity now fact aware idea expansion economy driven let say productivity shark drive economic activity pull oil price peoplehow people characterise rise oil price now suppose fact productivity shark happen abroad lot productivity shark occurring united state place china india brazil lot peoplethe lot people looked sort said well give supply shark chinese oil drive price oil life supply shark turn country experiencing kind productivity shark therere spillover country productivity shark favourable productivity shark experienced china brazil india led smaller favourable productivity shark united state now supported growing body research year lutz kilian university michigan people whos work areahas produced paper believe working couple people mine ycel vice president federal reserve bank dallas nathan balke southern methodist university found similar kind result people working board governor federal reserve system worked people working european monetary authority found workfound result this kind welldocumented research now widely known move adam talked now positive relationship oil price upbetween oil price consumption capita income pretty strong relationship perfect country ly curve weve happen country china india move consumption energy move what driving energy market recent year opinion positive relationship economic activity energy consumption increasing demand energy worldwide adam covered enough talk much basically storey strong global demand oil supply development lagged behind lot reason including oil peak oil plateau matt simmon jim smith argued opec restrained adding capacity restrained production restrained adding capacity fair amount work identifying national oil company inefficient lagging investment fact rational investment oil sector lagging term productivity gain that expectation demand grow led idea oil price continue rising fear supply disruption tight market weakening dollar covered today possibility unrealistic expectation dont spend time talking detail point elasticity supply demand energy market extremely low meaning bit shortness market lead volatile price price collapse pretty obvious oil worldwide recession capacity addition starting catch fact chart weve presentation earlier today excess opec capacity prettyis prettylarge led lessened impact supply disruption unwinding speculative position again pretty strong price collapse low elasticity supply demand moving forward oil price rebound standard storey hearing strengthening global economy boosting world oil demand strengthening global economy uneven point time led china india along continuing expectation oil supply development lag behind people project oil china consume imagine supply them earlier presentation notwithstanding possibility socalled oil hedge dollar resumed previous presentation suggested end takehave off what outlook world economy well international monetary fund growth pretty close prior recession fact period starting happen bit slower kind conventional thinking well kind temporary financial disruption market back kind were growth led emerging developing economy industrial production returning back trend globally that however kind international monetary fund kind standard outlook fact root current recession suggest recovery slow severe financial crisis driven financial real estate bubble argue insufficient market oversight contributed lax monetary policy loss confidence financial institution led financial institution keeping financing going however sign housing recovering confidence rebounding measured confidence indexe financing fully restored fact monetary policy adam mentioned risk economy start accelerating long hard swag well work reinhart rogoff suggest that fact youre financial crisis duration recovery bit longer normal recession wed slower economic activity slower economic recovery normal kind evidence seeing couple scenarios recovery previous trend turn back previous trend lot think outlook suggest return back previous trend kind return previous trend return growth rate slower growth energy timeslower growth energy demand therere people falling pace personal fall scenario economy enter recession make grow recession arent made grow recession economy reorganising consequently confident seecontinue seerobust growth world forward now thought interesting put history eia oil price forecast laugh belonged international energy workshop consensus expert consensus expert pretty youre eia youre laughing expert let current outlook current eia outlook kind based resumption world economic growth capacity fail pace growth demand growing reliance alternative heavy difficultand heavy difficult refine crude essentially moving light oil oil harder produce economic growth continue unabated sorry let sort strong world oil demand growth dargay gately eia wrong theyve completely underestimated growth demand based income projection using therere number factor moderate oil demand growth all lot conservation result higher price result evolving technology movement vehicle electric hybrid lot oil consumed electric hybrid mean transportation sector movement lighter weight vehicle fact emergence energy pattern dont asian oil european american ill why here everybody asian energy everybody sort arent transportation sector tatas theyre gridlock burning oil well reality asian gridlock reality asia today lee schipper studying transportation asia future transportation asia low oil use coal perhap natural gas generate electricity that all economy isnt robust growing future and secondly energy pattern bit different softer energy price result that that possibility resource world return abundant oil supply give lower price range show here right conclude weak global economy depressed oil price economic recovery boosting world oil demand oil hedge dollar unwound unwinding pressure oil while oil price reallyas move forward recovery take hold oil price range sustainable based economic condition timing remain question beginning slow recovery people expect continue happening united state well attention adam steve much speaker matt roger matt senior adviser secretary energy recovery act andand role responsibility cool righthe giving billion

resource scale example shale gas onis hasnt hit shale gas breakthrough idea don adam bakken oil type reservoir don well idea have know basically unconventional reservoir source rock they know oil gas perfectly conventional essentialize rubblize scale controlledbecause youre doing youre basically fracturing material creating surface area hundred time thousand time natural fracture structure arei people begin understand opportunity expand amount fracturing materially then know time increase fracture density factor youve huge exposure surface areas lot enormous formation formation thousand

early shale gase said aha moment individual looked said that said well realise early player shale gase texas louisiana influence country world good company answer end mean year half ago company active developing play realised full potential scale don answer know change something big surprise matt let finish question comment this don mentioned institutional factor employing developing deploying smart grid how case consumer didnt willing guess their know electric metre showing butbut way deal issue that institutional standpoint slow effort innovate technology energy area matt don point institutional factor behavioural factor largely study underunderstood weve part recovery act major investment areas working council economic adviser running sery randomised economic experiment people
