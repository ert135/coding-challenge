Jake R. Just to be clear, scientists have already replicated the processes that power the sun on Earth. Of course it couldn’t be harnessed or controlled, it was just exploded on a small island in the Pacific. PCAH Why on earth would you want to recreate the sun on earth? We’ve already got THE SUN, it’s up there, safely in the sky, just waiting for more of us to get the message that we can focus it on earth with PV sites anywhere in the world interconnected and
