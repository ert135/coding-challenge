While the realities of implementation are far more difficult than the reports suggest, these models can serve as a helpful exercise in imagining what is possible. Stanford professor Mark Jacobson has recently released some new calculations. He concludes that, by 2050, onshore and offshore wind, utility-scale and rooftop PV, concentrated solar power, geothermal, wave, t","m_szDocBody":"blueprint percent renewable midcentury herman trabish comment clean energy sector awash scenarios suggest percent energy met renewable reality implementation difficult report suggest model serve helpful exercise imagining possible stanford professor mark jacobson recently released calculation conclude that onshore offshore wind utilityscale rooftop concentrated solar power geothermal wave tidal conventional hydropower meet percent energy demand there generation jacobson call wind water sunlight wws electric power technology solution project study percent existing energy replaced wws reach percent renewable power plant clean renewable plant jacobson said car sold today fifteen year car electric average renewable achievable energy efficiency cut total energy demand percent study conclude percent electricity use buildout percent land scenario battery electric vehicle bevs hydrogen fuel cell vehicle hfcvs hybrid make transportation fleet hydrogen produced wwsgenerated electricity truck buse hybrid bevhfcvs pure hfcvs jacobson buse solelybevs fast battery swapping supercharging available jacobson conclusion similar finding work university delaware researcher plan eliminate nuclear energy energy intensity time horizon jacobson analysis fossil fuel mining uranium refining time amount wind energy unit energy produced addition nuclear facility take nineteen year operation wws project year liquid biofuel included effective cost liquid biofuel time electric power needed move electric car distance resource mix state state reflected study focusing california york washington interactive map created report california mix percent solar percent wind jacobson said bulk solar commercial industrial governmentscale installation utilityscale project percent residential rooftop require million system averaging kilowatt each million residential rooftop kind including single multiple unit structure million jacobson said bottom line saturating rooftop home accommodate system also added rooftop solar presently expensive utilityscale solar plan flexible change rooftop solar laid scenario possible long based wind water solar jacobson work include list recommended policy support percent renewable leave final decision option state leadership nationally plan create estimated million construction job million permanent annual job extremely confident net job gain nationally job renewable local jacobson said solar construction produce job kilowatthour traditional generation jacobson projection suggest cost advantage renewablesthe levelized cost energyfor wws technology expected kilowatthour including cost local transmission jacobson research conclude fossil fuel lcoe projection fall kilowatthour range excluding externality cost longdistance transmission projected kilowatthour hvdc line kilometre fuel cost fossil fuel rise time fuel cost wws energy resource zeroww energy save average consumer year compared energy cost fossil fuel conclude study saving aggressive policy put place immediately jacobson said price down policy impact reduced technically economically feasible jacobson said require overcoming political barrier people energyefficient light bulb appliance weatherizing buying electric car putting solar roof push local government policy form energy future greentech media gtm produce industryleading new research conference businesstobusiness greentech market coverage areas include solar smart grid energy efficiency wind nonincumbent energy market information visit greentechmediacom follow twitter facebook related post ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.theenergycollective.com/hermantrabish/352551/another-blueprint-100-percent-renewables-mid-century","m_Places":["United States","California","New York","Washington"],"m_People":["Herman Trabish","Mark Jacobson"],"m_Companies":["University Of Delaware","Energy Future","Facebook"],"m_BiGrams":["jacobson said","fossil fuel","percent renewable"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,4,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":451}
