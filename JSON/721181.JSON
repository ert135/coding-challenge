Not only does pollution effect breathing, but it also creates a green house effect from green houses gasses, this means heat gets in through the atmosphere, but can't get out. There is an obvious correlation between increased air pollution and climatic flux, as more pollution is pumped into the atmosphere sea levels rise, ice caps melt, and temperatures across the world
