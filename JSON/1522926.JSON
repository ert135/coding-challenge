A few solar panels connected to an inverter, plus a battery no bigger than those found inside an electric vehicle. That’s all it takes for a village in Kenya that never before had electricity to not only light up homes but also enable some businesses to power refrigerators and computers. The collection of electrical parts providing the new source of power is called a microgrid .
