By Henry Lindon Russia, along with its Central Asian neighbors, could hit the 100% renewable electricity mark as soon as 2030, while actually significantly cutting costs rather than increasing them, according to a new study from Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland. According to the researchers, the cost of electricity from a renewable energy buildout in the area would be roughly half of that of new nuclear power plants, o","m_szDocBody":"russia central asia hit
