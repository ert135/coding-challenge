Go to permalink Elon Musk has never been a proponent of the universe's most abundant element, hydrogen. Well, at least in the context of a fuel source for an electric car. This is not a new stance for him, but it is one he reiterated last month at a press conference . So, why, exactly, is he such an H-phobe, and is he right? There's been a good number of arguments for and against Musk's position. Let's try to get to the basic thrust of both sides so we can make sense of it. But before we do that, let's just quickly go over ","m_szDocBody":"elon musk hydrogen fuel cell extremely silly really permalink elon musk proponent universe abundant element hydrogen well context fuel source electric car stance him reiterated month press conference why exactly hphobe right good number argument musk position basic thrust side make sense that quickly hydrogen electric car prius drive toyotas hydrogen car prius drive toyotas hydrogen car prius drive toyota hydrogen fuel cell cool technology perfected enable human moon read read run electric car source duh electricity conventional batterypowered electric car storage battery capable storing electricity provided source battery charged source store energy with generally pretty minimal loss source electricity absolutely anything coal solar nuclear dog treadmill etc modern battery pretty good heavy bulky long time charge advertisement fuel cell again simplifying wildly take source hydrogen oxygen air chemically combine produce flow electron electricity water fuel cell apollo spacecraft great electricity source drinking water eliminating haul heavy water space sponsored now hydrogen abundant element universe there interstellar space inside unpleasantly hot star earth trickier get fair amount effort needed extract source methane natural gas hydrocarbon process take energy hydrogen extremely flammable tricky transport store take energy material effort well caveat heart elon musk think hydrogen bullshit car fuel overall systemslevel viewpoint evaluating extra step involved initial conversion motion nuclear reaction combustion electricity storing car purely scientific standpoint absolutely storing electricity battery way efficient production preparation hydrogen transport storage energy charge battery driving car musk explaining himself hydrogen energy storage mechanism source energy hydrogen somewhere hydrogen water splitting electrolysis extremely inefficient energy process solar panel energy charge battery pack directly compared split water hydrogen dump oxygen compress hydrogen extremely pressure liquefy put car run fuelcell half efficiency terrible that make sense pretty hard argue with and really argue that cold unfeeling science hydrogenhead argue other realworld aspect biggest recharge time accept that told fuel cell half efficient battery storage change teslas supercharger recharging station hour recharge time case teslas supercharger offer free superfast solar charging teslas supercharger offer free superfast solar charging teslas supercharger offer free superfast sol tesla motor unveiled supercharger cool mad max kind read read supercharger driving electric car compatible supercharger realistically overnight charge slow real issue based live drive hydrogen fuel cell though offer time gasoline car big deal easy give shit electricity storage system half efficient battery refill hydrogen tank minute system bulky heavy battery bulky heavy reinforced kevlarweave hydrogen tank bulky heavy call draw sure hydrogen flammable potentially explosive tesla caught fire safety risk liion battery risk electrocution careful extremely unlucky thing course change tesla open batteryswapping station teasing forever new energycheaper extracting acquiring hydrogen found make hydrogen ice engine viable too pulled lot combustion event stand now rational debate elon musk technically correct kind correct battery storage way efficient energy fullstop question problem real world sloppy mess that vast majority driver ability rapidly recharge outweigh efficiency advantage driver perceive technology environment nope people give shit pick minute recharge hour recharge nope infrastructure hydrogen battery infancy battery swap station start popping quick easy one attempt failed hydrogen network piggyback vast network gas station ubiquitous easy early tell hear musk lambast hydrogen idiot fuel mind true beautiful clean world science elon float arranging molecule bare hand shithole driving yet ","m_szGeo1":"","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://jalopnik.com/elon-musk-hydrogen-fuel-cells-are-extremely-silly-a-1686545341","m_Places":["Toyota","Tesla"],"m_People":["Elon","Li"],"m_Companies":["Cool Technology","Tesla Motors","Mad"],"m_BiGrams":["fuel cell","electric car","elon musk","teslas supercharger","hydrogen fuel","car prius","prius drive","supercharger offer","offer free","free superfast","bulky heavy"],"m_TriGrams":["hydrogen fuel cell","car prius drive","teslas supercharger offer","supercharger offer free","offer free superfast"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,5,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3,3,3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":533}
