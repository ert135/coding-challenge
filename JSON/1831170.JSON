forecasting business year now ive learned business forecast midterm long term short term enough largely because course market change time policy assumption make price assumption make assumption economic growth impact forecast aggressively important understand forecast structured theyre including assumption lot factor feel forecaster thought process energy market ultimately biggest forecast crystal ball back forecast year ago isnt wouldnt redo that process thinking future evolve what important future contribution forecaster generally make that let started tom eizember tom you paul paul mentioned exxon mobil corporate planning department dallas year corporate planning presentsprepare longterm energy outlook guide internal business planning weve year year recently started sharing key point outlook public policy maker raise awareness issue understanding energy business now paul mentioned outlook global energy type world work individual country region total hundred demand sector

transforming energy sector note here mean dont build more dont net addition required forecast fact industrial client worry though lot capacity switched out older coal capacity replaced newer coal capacity put lot scrubber activity sector kind activity forecast showing net annual addition year forecast show fuel requirement building renewable retiring remaining oil plant retiring bit natural gas plant remaining steam unit natural gas shut year slight change coal due switch refurbish coal unit forecast tom gig nuclear coming term generation noncarbon fuel dominate increase generating fuel gas move begin absorb build natural gas unit year coal net loser reason coal generation declining switch out case now power retired coal unit built coal unit tonnage term generation tonnage know theyre reducing tonnage lot increase efficiency relative unit unit irp gasagain irp movement stated dominated improve efficiency putting pollution abatement equipment improve efficiency existing unit now dont natural gas stuff recently built coal tremendous opportunity improve efficiency reduce coal tonnage natural gas well driver talking term industrial output growing faster real gep change industrial gas demand major industry natural gas forecast slight decline residential demand natural gas saturated market commercial stay flat growing anymore change industrial natural gas demand growing very slowly year gas market well inaudible growth market steal coal electric sector activity sector generate anything good bad thing tom discussed development shale tremendous opportunity united state advantage domestic resource forecast low growth electricity demand growth sector situation shutting gas opportunity bigger let tcf year demand continued pressure gas market forced lng price gas million btu wellhead forecast opportunity additional gas isnt there doesnt make carbon programme kind forced back end demand natural gas tcf forecast interval opportunity supply side tcf changing industry theyre create demand natural gas big pressure gas industry transportation market transportation market absorb natural gas influencing development phevs model overcome programme coal market well answer carbon tax carbon fee programme all tremendous investment coal now this cumulative picture period approximately coal capacity scrubber installed period however pre installed scrubber third mean invested scrubber tune coal capacity tremendous impact drop bottom nox market theyre pretty now coal consumption well significant sector also situation where requirement developed

indiana illinois company consolidated investing developing sulphur coal coal capacity scrubber scrubber nox market scrubber take lot mercury also coming shift back sulphur coal low sulphur coal west forecast show inaudible coal production sulphur coal region shifting back illinois back ohio northeast appalachia region increase coalit complicatedthat central appalachia west virginia basically decline coal coming central appalachia low sulphur region shifted higher sulphur region indiana ohio illinois change coal market tremendous impact rail rail big built move prb coal east tremendous opportunity tremendous transformation coal market forward year said forecast evolutionary revolutionary tremendous coming rework entire market year you paul mary speaker john conti again remind question pleasei pile hereplease make out thank john good afternoon everyone started envisioning session number month ago thought interesting exercise comparison model result started realizei tremendous exercise take month effort wasnt happen presentation today glad tom picture world emphasis united state mary presented forecast hope summary eias reference case that itself take hour throw slide putting exxon mobil result global insight result side give flavour result different paul started off interesting people model work model provide methodology providing projection bring important difference projection weve sort touched already guess people result dont conclusion away start guess ill disclaimer start macroeconomic result aeo ihs global insight incorporated model our mary presenting recent aeo basically theyre thing gdp grow population grow labour force productivity alluded mary earlier recession profound lasting gdp return level primary energy consumption return level emission return level year recession longlasting impact energy market right slide basic result aeo guess start major assumption obvious away know aeo basically assume current law regulation tom forecast basically assume carbon tax there produce profound difference projection incorporated recently enacted cafe standard bit detail interesting thing couple year ago capital expansion coal power happening noticed risk premium putting onon sort intensive technology incorporated methodology model aeo commercial technology exist today breakthrough technology secretary alluded early morning theyre there dont today inaudible benches today included aeo however include improvement technology cost performance right lot slide some skip paul give warning close end time question answer right year extended period performance model included recently enacted cafe standard number inaudible year make assumption nuclear plant life basically assume extended year revised capital cost okay forecast current forecast obvious number report capital intensive technology expensive cost building coal plant nuclear plant projected cost carbon control sequestration increased pretty dramatically since time aeo weve incorporated here main sort happened past year talked today shale gas think credit eia projection included shale gas year year ago year back revisit bigger year modelling geek perspective added lower onshore oil gas supply module key result alluded earlier lot projection energy growth modern projection fairwell nota moderate growth gdp lot energy efficiency standard programme effect result somesome moderate growth energy consumption mary said declining reliance tom well declining reliance imported liquid fuel oil stay close current level today growth transportation liquid fuel met increased biofuel tom alluded exxon mobil forecast dont meet ease target eventually met projection mary said electricity consumption slightly much year energyrelated emission fairly flat growing year projection period due number factor right let key difference projection here pretty obvious know aeo ihs global projection differ major input assumption price oil know aeo number case world oil price low world oil price case think finally emitting project price oil people exxon mobil year year ago anyway note chart price barrel end projection period today global insight projection fairly flat real term projection period scenarios number assumption them main assumption opec continue produce worldof crude oil theyve number year theyre continue future sort help formulate price projection price slightly lower year projection year due higher elasticity demand greater drop petroleum demand expected continued limitation rich nonopec country continued strain growth nonopec liquid production ill leave move okay introduce concept here now thei dont confused future slide illustrate wanted compare tom projection case alluded richard morning analysis congress cap trade legislation markeywaxman legislation wanted compare tom projection wed bar excuse point this bar hung right result markeywaxman analysis key note lot similar exxon mobil projection primary energy supply lot lower aeo reference case noticed coal dramatically less natural gas slightly less different nuclear higher renewable higher aeo reference case year projection similar global insight exxon mobil result petroleum demand basically flat coal projection increase slightly natural gas increase slightly nuclear increase slightly renewable increase fairly dramatically hydro renewable liquid biofuel grow meet additional liquid demand transportation sector right point highlight mary directly minute ago function mostlyokay solid line aeo reference case reference case basically top line consumption slightly the guess the darker red line solid line production faster consumption result net import liquid decrease peak year ago excuse now compare ihs global insight projection line consumption fairly similar know robust return recession here real difference production production basically increase due offshore liquid production enhanced oil recovery whereas global insight production basically continue past trend show decreasing production lower bump year sort note potentially explore future everyone touched cafe standard found interesting havent fully digested yet make comparison lightduty vehicle road efficiency understanding chart half hour understand thisand person explained sitting back roomokay starting cafe standard mile gallon part met greenhouse gas credit name make own anyway car lowe glass improve aero dynamic sealant refrigeration unit credit basically mile gallon remainder made traditional cafe fuel efficiency standard okay that bring mile gallon specific year start hurt standard effect past alternative compliance credit banked alternative fuel credit banked automotive industry lot these early year result that onroad efficiency excuse tested efficiency drop mile gallon finally onroad degradation drop lower mile gallon year understand basically exxon mobil projection fairly similar long time forecast global insight result chart differ somehow additional adjustment transportation fuel line better right projection aeo guess point significant increase unconventional vehicle forecast grow half vehicle fleet term sale guess point ill make interest time that carbon tax drop middle bar hear markeywaxman analysis heck lot hybrid vehicle slightly fossilflex fuel vehicle road intensively reference case scenario diesel vehicle well know tremendous amount biofuel car scenario reference scenario more exxon mobil advanced cellulosic technology biomasstoliquid technology part cellulosic okay right here part comparison global insight projection show aeo basically natural gas price increasing forecast lowslet screen big screenso low today increasing projection period bump back session increasing projection period global insight projection fairly flat real term natural gas wellhead price increasingly difficult develop natural gas shale gas available necessarily very cheap produce cheaper people thought past natural gas matter fact year annual energy outlook natural gas price lower year natural gas price point mary made earlier compare crude oil natural gas price projecting world respect oil natural gas price ratio past average know this separation oil gas market north america inaudible guess eastern basin well global insight slightly higher past oil price basically increase lot faster natural gas price due transportation demand increasing world fairly abundant supply natural gas united state right natural gas from big growth areas shale gas areas gas mobilthe alaska pipeline year forecast delayed alaska pipeline year initially time due economic natural gas effect here move faster time left mary earlier electricity growth slowing weve noticed past year weve slowing growth rate dont know past year growth rate year aeo depending span year choose projection period mary implication capacity youre need capacity mary alluded earlier break chart part certainly big donut left capacity today larger section coal natural gas large section hydropower nuclear renewable top donut expect reference case dont capacity gigawatt projection period met combination natural gas renewable coal addition planned today end forecast carbon tax cap trade proposal weve heard today expect coal competitive choice again however move cap trade regime coal add herefirst capacity youre retire capacity coal build replace existing coal carbon capture storage build natural gas because know unlike tom alluded earlier coal carbon capture storage carbon constrained world cheaper natural gas carbon capture storage basically fuel cost lower coal squeeze natural gas further also big growth renewable big growth nuclear right catch note here similar chart represented electricity generation share coal growing share decline slightly projection period nuclear capacity generation increasing share nuclear decrease natural gas basically stay constant higher period end slightly less big growth area course renewable number reason slide probably okay slide sort decompose somewhat term expect lot built forthcoming year production tax credit slated expire fund recent reinvestment recovery act expect wind capacity edition moderate significantly time programme mary alluded renewable portfolio standard require increased renewable state level drive biomass consumption biomass generation finally carbon emission left today expect grow end projection period big increase markeywaxman world course significantly squeeze significant amount carbon emission electric power sector existing coal repower coal carbon capture storage nuclear renewable lot debate what role natural gas carbonconstrained world depend number factor depend price gas depend price alternative carbon capture storage hasnt commercialised yet price nuclear built yet assumption aeo basically carbon emission traditional coal plant natural gas combined cycle carbon constrained world push natural gas replaced carbonfree source that stop paul okay moment question question moment for sort addressed everybody well everybody first that personsince tom dealt international asked forecast exxon forecast compared iea give chance address starting point tom yes relative international energy recent forecast world energy outlook forecast total liquid demand lower their liquid petroleum liquid biofuel slightly higher forecast biofuel production difference appear pessimistic areas brazil european sugar beet palm oil kind indonesia now point liquid forecast lower eias fairly substantial difference there unfortunately dont specific total energy relative iea give that paul okay general question panel whole couple question topic uncertainty people tend forecast basically point disagreement started talking uncertainty forecast level agreement major concern there dont start for key uncertainty john start paul ahead john guess number certainty weve heard today future policy effect know world term energy policy climate policy uncertainty certainly know difference projection threw out vastly energy outcome due potential policy addition that alluded today technology breakthrough potential technology breakthrough occur today result energy projection uncertainty well theyre smaller chinas grow year unheard grown fast year theyre grow year uncertainty inherent there ill guy add that tom ill emphasise policy significant uncertainty nuclear nuclear europe part europe talking shutting nuclear plant time additional power extend time period clearly build nuclear potentially replace coal dependent supportive policy not policy part sure policy causative carbon causative green house gas emission back minute suggest hear lot carbon cost cost term greenhouse gas emission cost emission fossil fuel total greenhouse gas emission youre talking reduction waxmanmarkey working address rest greenhouse gas emission john mentioned economic activity side uncertainty well chart recent year pretty radically forecast year ago mary mind alternative transportation technology electric vehicle significant share market significant share market depending coal increased opportunity natural gas market switch vehicle electric side market played remarkably dominant role transformation energy sector year dont people understand recycling recycle product that know dont virgin product needed year ago plastic recycling take kind energy dont virgin product industrial outlook mind increasing recycling end big influence total demand energy rate increase mine recycled material next big system changer coming one paul okay question tom dont send question price question asked mary john pointed out forecasted show large disparity oil gas price rising oiltogas price ratio question just exxon disparity expect sustainable possibility away tom interesting question history forward fewer fewer linkage oil price gas price substantial substitution power generation sector day oil power generation middle east small amount emergency generator make unreliable production india china substitution capability chemical production steam cracker producing electricity run oil gas volume small clear strong linkage necessarily continue forward paul mary you theyre gas price million btu theyre potential natural gas vehicle natural gas vehicle vehicle mary well policy question natural gas vehiclesit vehicle issue infrastructure put infrastructure now gas pipeline run interstate highway hear gas fueling station interstate standpoint support people convert part truck fleet natural gas generally interstate kind hard infrastructure natural gas vehicle light duty vehicle fleet dont natural gas vehicle dont government put big programme put infrastructure vehicle manufacture first chicken egg all gigantic government programme put infrastructure place that youre natural gas vehicle two well alternative vehicle structure electric vehicle kind fuel mean plug electricity know advantage coal natural gas whatever now electric vehicle forecast dont natural gas vehicle forecast big assumption infrastructure side paul tom follow question specifically targeted you mary raised infrastructure natural gas vehicle fleet exxon perspective that tom you ill back slightly perspective natural gas vehicle policy suggest fundamental economic problem natural gas substantially difficult gasoline problem electricity problem hydrogen create put vehicle pressurised containment natural gas give kind range gasoline vehicle expensive buy natural gas honda civic today thousand dollar more today fuel price difference gas oil economic vehicle generally wont make sense assume oil gas price difference remain whack indefinitely future infrastructure natural gas vehicle operating today retail selfservice natural gas dispenser canada theyve put place south america economic equipping vehicle hold natural gas compressed form generally doesnt work passenger vehicle make sense centrally fueled fleet delivery truck fleet instance theyre necessarily constrained weight dont huge range theyre coming back place evening fuel theyre struggling massive amount pressurised storage vehicle give typical personal vehicle range paul john question you obviously tom showed forecast gigawatt additional nuclear capacity billed assume worldwide wasnt worldwide john sorry china building four five gigawatt nuclear plant year paul forecast mary gigawatt gigawatt nuclear obviously eia forecast lower person asking low nuclear capacity john nuclear capacity expensive basic answer price people know all accused nuclear price year weve accused nuclear price low accused nuclear price high currently price order say kilowatt build nuclear power plant well today current price natural gas combined cycle today current price natural gas wouldnt build nuclear plant youd build natural gas combined cycle however carbon constrained world scenarios build nuclear power basically price electric power sector paul stay you john ill back direction asked outlook relative hydrogen fuel fact penetration forecast john yes weve hydrogen projection forecast number year now weve service report dont fuel make lot competitive sense market basically answer that expensive generate technology need fuel cell expensive policy subsidise instal infrastructure requirement wouldnt reference case forecast paul tom question conventional gas europe obviously showed tremendous growth shale very tom yes part understanding potential exist europe point part substantial part europe heavily populated difficult resource there europe continue north sea gas russia break recording caspian gas competitive production cost standpoint youll drive unconventional europe what leading forecast paul okay mary question energy price potential theyre worded here ihs global pessimistic chemical industry isnt lower cost energy attraction spur manufacturing mary might chemical industry decline united state long time reason partly due recycling longer exporter chemical chemical production united state growingexpanding rapidly weve know weve kind wiped export market meeting current domestic need product chemical beingwere importing now importing finished product producing united state combination effect make outlook chemical natural gas lower mean chemical sector chemical sector tremendous growth pharmaceutical element chemical index global insight youd pretty robust number know basic chemical produced natural gase feedstock dont growth there paul okay john technical question can anyway write wind generation grow significant percentage total eia continue account share thermal electrical output thermal equivalent comparable fossil fuel input account energy john excellent question excellent question let audience studyrene you study eia evaluating account thermal equivalent renewable fuel electricity producing fossil unit displacing traditional measure eia million btu pure engineering type estimate between answer evaluating back forth nowe iea havent made decision forward switch accounting year annual energy review table back alternative way oppose standard way paul right question time weve run minute everybody traditional question delay expect alaskan gas pipeline built john ive answered already paul two tom alaskan gas pipeline conventional block showed upward movement timeframe timing highly dependent again policy supply demand development united state expensive pipeline paul mary mary include paul mary forecast john hydrogen mary yes horizon built well depend forecast natural gas hovering tcf natural gas forever know meeting forecast period domestic end forecast period question bring alaskan gas pipeline adequate supply lng compete now kind push pipeline
