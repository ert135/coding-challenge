Renewable Energy Highlights and Commentary Like it? 0 Posted November 26, 2008 In Part I , I presented the notes on renewable energy that I took as I read through the 2008 International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook. Here in Part II, I organize those notes, and then provide some general comments and conclusions. I am now offline for a few days. Happy holidays to those who celebrate Thanksgiving. ------------------------- As I read through the 2008 International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook, I had the distinct impression that
