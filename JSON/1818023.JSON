March 15th, 2015 by Sandy Dechert   We’ve heard some cautious rejoicing comes from scientists and media this weekend about the world economy and energy carbon dioxide emissions finally decoupling last year. World emissions of CO2 remained at 32.3 billion tons in 2014, while world GDP figures grew by 2.9%. Many analysts have hailed the change as showing that emission reduction efforts to combat climate change may be bearing more fruit than previously calculated.
