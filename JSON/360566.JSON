It is any substance that can be manipulated into a controlled release of its energy. 'Controlled release' being the operative word because an element that reacts instantaneously or alters its chemical makeup when in contact with Oxygen cannot be deemed fuel. Hydrocarbons are the most commonly explored sources of energy. They are stable and have limitless uses. Petroleum, diesel, gasoline are some examples of fuels extracted from hydrocarbons, which ","m_szDocBody":"way filling car future tuesday follow follow fuel store house energy substance manipulated
