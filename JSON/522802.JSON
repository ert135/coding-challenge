The new ones may be more expensive, but the world will adapt. Prices will rise and people will learn to do more with less. Everything will work out in the end. It is only a matte","m_szDocBody":"posted keyword electricity energy security sustainability utility efficiency environmental policy risk management energy economy fuel economic limitation future
