S. would require to generate all its electricity from wind? What and when is peak electricity demand USA? It probably occurs in the month of January, that is when I have my peak electric bill. Bob_Wallace Would you mind if I answered using 3 MW turbines?  (Iâ€™ve already done that math and can just copy it over.  Along with land requirements.) In 2010, the US used 4,143 TWh (terawatt hours) of electricity. (11,300,000 MWh per day.) The average wind turbine is around 3 MW in size and median cap","m_szDocBody":"informative new world wind power tttiara wind turbine require generate electricity wind peak electricity demand usa occur
