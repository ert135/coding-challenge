Air is used to ventilate the fuel cell stack enclosure. The air may be pulled from an air stream used to cool a high voltage battery. The air may also be pulled from a vehicle compartment such as a vehicle trunk or vehicle cabin. Filters are used to remove particulate matter from the air. Images(4) Â  Claims(20) 1.
