Two reactions take place in the cathode, in which the reversible cell voltage is 2.959 V and 2.013 V, respectively. The reversibility of the two reactions may vary under given conditions. The current density of the lithium-air cell may be as high as 250 mAgâ1. This high current density is related to the amount of carbon used. The lower the amount of carbon used, the higher the energy capacity. If the current density and the amount of carbon used are constant, the higher the oxygen mobility, the more the energy capacity i","m_szDocBody":"reaction anode take place reverse reaction place
