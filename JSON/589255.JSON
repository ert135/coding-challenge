See how it scores Â» { action.text } A startup says its technical advances could make fuel cells as cheap as grid power. By Kevin Bullis on August 22, 2013 Why It Matters Storms and other issues are making backup power increasingly important, but diesel generators are loud and dirty. Cheaper cell: A complete generator from Redox would feature several stacks of these ceramic plates.
