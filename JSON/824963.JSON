Tweet A wind farm in Tehachapi, California. (REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni ) Renewable energy has had a busy year. California and New York have adopted ambitious plans calling for 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. A group of Stanford and Berkeley scientists has put forth an even bolder vision—encouraging all 50 states to run on wind, water, and solar by 2050, without any nuclear energy or biofuels in the picture.
