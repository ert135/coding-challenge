Ok so if there is an auto accident that unfortunatley a couple people die, it is nothing like the earth and atmosphere being polluted and ruined, and changing life as we now knoe it. OMG you say you worked with the stuff for 30 years. How much longer do they last. Are they in the time period yet that they are patching things to get by and save money. It is like our infrastructure, sewers water lines etc they are going to wear down and then what?
