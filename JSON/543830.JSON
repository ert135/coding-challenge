improve rest doing hanne apitzsch rest hurry making math starting low voltage information provided morning remaining part lmv business room improvement effect well roland busch sorry locomotive andreas willi morgan chase research division low voltage sector division same medium voltage mark rate down roland busch all improve margin improve margin firstly secondly smart grid staying highly competitive level staying improving improving low voltage product plant eur billion plant bring bottom line talking about andreas willi morgan chase research division data centre data centre great market year confidence time push roland busch growing market mean data centre built everywhere growing market growth rate market double digit eur billion market growth rate growing slowdown all mariel von drathen okay well row olivier esnou please olivier esnou exane bnp paribas research division olivier esnou exane yes reading transcript actually year ago sector created question mind time supposed year market target imc really reading detail transcript found that time highlighted construction channel gap lacking scale sort low voltage space understand pure sense comfortable that wondering changed term scale accessibility construction lastly jochen highlighted central unit risk portfolio expert team theoretically apply you interfacing them involved involved happening team basically roland busch repeat one clear olivier esnou exane bnp paribas research division well sector created year ago actually wondering year really plan roland busch okay well one eur billion unit people
