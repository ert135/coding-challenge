by Joshua S Hill   A report released by Greenpeace on Thursday based on analysis done by consultants Energynautics has floated the idea of a need for a pan-European supergrid to help meet the ambitious target of at least 45% renewables by 2030. “Europe’s energy system is at a crossroads,” the authors of the report write, noting that the existing “large, polluting power plants” need to be shut down and replaced by renewable energy growth “if we are to have a truly sustainable energy system.” Following in the wake of the European ren","m_szDocBody":"greenpeace pushing paneuropean
