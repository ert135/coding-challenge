One of the best compliments I ever received came from one of my division officers when I was serving as the Engineer Officer on a submarine – he told me “Eng, you ask hard questions.” As vocal advocate for nuclear fission power I recognize that it has many associated questions, but I after 30 years of study, I have determined to my own satisfaction that ","m_szDocBody":"evaluating
