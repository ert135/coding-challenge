Detailed Description Of The Invention Metal-air batteries contain an anode which is made from metals that can be oxidized during discharge in a metal-oxygen cell to produce electrical energy. Such metals include lead, zinc, lithium, iron, cadmium, aluminum, and magnesium. Zinc is normally preferred because of its availability, energy density, safety, and relatively low cost. An electrolyte is also provided. Generally, an aqueous electrolyte solution of the Group I metal hydroxides is used. For example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hyd","m_szDocBody":"oxygen concentrator battery detailed description invention metalair battery anode made metal oxidised discharge metaloxygen cell produce electrical energy metal include lead zinc lithium iron cadmium aluminium magnesium zinc preferred availability energy density safety low cost electrolyte provided generally aqueous electrolyte solution metal hydroxide used example lithium hydroxide sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide cesium hydroxide like metalair battery air permeable cathode invention utilise oxygen concentrator air reactant air oxygen greater flow air required provide required oxygen cathode concentrating oxygen air permeable cathode simplify battery design rotary compressor driven battery air flow past moving vehicle create pressurised air variable compressor controlled feedback loop used optionally air passed water humidify humidifier oxygen concentrator oxygen concentrator compressed air passed oxygen concentrator molecular sieve membrane oxygen pass nitrogen vented oxygen concentrated small amount carbon dioxide nitrogen water referred high purity oxygen preferred oxygen concentrator zeolite molecular sieve absorbent material activated carbon molecular sieve absorb argon combination zeolite carbon dioxide oxygen stream exiting oxygen concentrator absorbed small cartridge absorbent material calcium oxide lithium hydroxide oxygen humidified exit cartridge prior concentration apparatus arid climate water reservoir humidifier valve controlled water sensor battery control amount water entering battery oxygen flow rate valve control amount oxygen entering battery control flow rate oxygen battery matches load battery pressurised oxygen flow insure complete mixing dispersion oxygen oxygen electrode pressure relief vent remaining gas water atmosphere battery pressure release valve release nitrogen water air nitrogen desorbed form zeolite regenerative purge flow zeolite bed step cycle bed pair bed one zeolite carbon receive pressure air feed gas pressurise bed establishes oxygen flow simultaneously pressure gas bed vented lower pressure depressurization serve desorb nitrogen argon previously adsorbed pressure phase cycle see issued oxygen concentrator large battery electrical vehicle preferred smaller oxygen concentrator make smaller battery oxygen inlet air manager system set initially predetermined position based status load control amount oxygen supplied cell order ensure oxygen flow react entire surface cathode direction oxygen flow changed plurality baffle incorporated pathway oxygen baffle changing direction flow oxygen define serpentine path surface cathode covering essentially point surface preferably cathode inlet outlet plurality baffle define torturous path oxygen flow inlet outlet catalytic element path oxygen flow catalysing recombination hydrogen oxygen gas generated rechargeable metal oxygen battery oxygen concentrator technology applied fuel cell hydrogen anode oxygen concentrator efficient source oxygen cell carbon monoxide air poison fuel cell oxygen concentrator purify source oxygen prevent limit interference carbon monoxide impurity air nonpatent citation ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_patents","m_szSrcUrl":"https://www.google.com/patents/EP1078412A1","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Zinc"],"m_Companies":["Path"],"m_BiGrams":["oxygen concentrator","oxygen flow","molecular sieve","control amount","battery oxygen"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[12,7,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":400}
