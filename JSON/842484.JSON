These cars generally use the hydrogen in one of two methods: combustion or fuel-cell conversion. In combustion, the hydrogen is \"burned\" in engines in fundamentally the same method as traditional gasoline cars. In fuel-cell conversion, the hydrogen is turned into electricity through fuel cells which then powers electric motors. With either method, the only byproduct from the spent hydrogen is water. Hydrogen can be obtained from decompositi","m_szDocBody":"powerpediahydrogen vehicle jump navigation hydrogen car automobile hydrogen primary source power locomotion car generally hydrogen method
