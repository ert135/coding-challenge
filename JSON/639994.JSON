Some of the numbers are quite stark — though not really surprising to anyone who’s already familiar with the subject. When you place a country’s rate of consumption against its rate of production, the picture painted is often quite bleak for many of th","m_szDocBody":"facing severe fossil fuel natural resource

ive idea lenr work care world energy problem basic line time person decent amount cash develop ive problem people probally amature witth degree laymen bit long alot work post ive leave contact hope hear soon this copy previous reader related subject day thinking nuclear reaction atom call like happy meaning atom atom charge distance nucleus shell electron shell spin ect atom stay balanced particle introduced atom imbalance nuclear reaction happen figured fission fusion that fusion temperature sun sun call plasma thinking heat heat cold doe super cold motion atom stop mean electron move higher shell energy put atom electron move higher shell till this questionable heat energy friction electron bumping particle making move electron higher shell electron leave atom expansion going higher shell make nucleus proton system reaction atom element making electron higher shell sooner electron leave atom causing imbalance atom nucleus bring proton balance atom electron higher shell atom compensate changing condition atom create balance pull electron nucleus create nuclear reaction nuclear reaction opposite fission done youve backward would physicist add proton atom shooting nucleus add atom taking apple placing apple making apple science happen atom split atom kinda backward backward fission logic fusion opposite procedure fission backward itself adding nuclous bring nother particle nuclous pulling electron nuclous pull electron idea useless control field tesla particle atom section pulling particle adding create fusion reaction explain large amount energy lenr science starting learn condition particle atom spin which energy idea deal spin too thinking opposite neg pos time reason time example read watched lecture harvard university quantum entanglement which listen min didnt quantum entanglement part confusing lecture talking electron north field align field release photon which concept energy idea spent time coming energy ideas intention started physic make cash family weird idea cold fusion long time idea minute contemplation refining month putting idea looked concept frog floating field mri work realisation particle magnetic position spin spin determine field react magnet work other earth magnetic north pole south pole react space solar system set atom gravity magnetic nature isnt manipulated understanding magnetic part mass boy attach compare gravity magnetic unified theory particle atom magnetic effected field formula amount tesla compared field north south pull electron atom create lenr reaction result fusion remember and help one element hydrogen helium formula north tesla south tesla reaction element element condition balance atom instead south north hydrogen atom set helium charge shell ect element mix teslas north south amount atom type element thought too dont problem base number call squared formulated two north south field time field pull electron atom rest atom follow particle atom balance field rest particle place field pull electron away formula amount force north compared amount south force element dont math out question mind fact figuring particle spin add amount tesla amount force needed particle that particle mass protonneutron electron spin let unit force tesla opposite force controlling force opposite sustaining force forgot calculate factor formula force needed force charge shell position particle spin forget dont weight mass particle thing reaction chain reaction happen start messing idea happen aware heavy radiation black holeswormhole happen careful chain reaction happen infinite fusion particle due chain reaction meaning element wild fire other hydrogen helium god like infinite energy black hole wormhole radiation ect addition tesla wrong sense particle spin tesla dont term measurement explain this laymen term dont formal education ged month college independent study physic friend knowledge too thought wrote email work particle atom figured property spin weight distance charge quark ect included thought factor field field strength after figured stronger holding field strength imbalance reaction idea work important one fact mind particle among universe ill explain later magnetic manipulated field two opposite fission fusion adding particle atom process removing particle atom complete opposite fission donethat now felt clear writing thought thing problem factor particle atom magnetic holding proton remove electron hard keeping nucleolus place spin particle weight gravity magnetic factor one larger magnetic particle add tesla larger gravity has two light photon magnetic effected gravity connexion ideas questionable fusion reaction laser frequency the higher frequency particle fit wave photoelectric effect photon move electron movement electron absorb photon movement higher shell atom because energy stop fusion reaction type remove force field question reaction stop variable fusion meet like hydrogen helium field removed reaction adding particle element till atom heavy tha fall for amount reason happen add till create singularity mass start black hole thought occur particle small considered smallest point singularity meaning hydrogen atom singularity idea photon small reason mass photon energy singularity start blackhole variable havent thought and express them now this made earlier explanation part reason fusion reaction base ground heat created photoelectric electron atom reactor adsorbing photon radiation energy level frequency higher frequency the space wave closeness peak photon wave photon electron adsorb photon adsorbed electron higher shell nucleus atom balance separate making condition fusion explain part email solution surround plant reactor giving problem atom element low energy atom atom electron lowest shell atom asorb photon radiation point before fusion happen combination magnetic field probably north field teslas higher tesla higher amount photon higher frequency released alignment dont guessing play this control rate radiation release intensity frequency radiation got idea magnetic field releasing photon electron align field line lecture standford university added rest amount tesla regulate radiation released brainfart another question proton atom asorb photon release opposite reaction electron magnetic spin effect field strength figured out reaction controlled fusion chain reaction happenthe ideas particle spin magnetic lecture talked mri work problem occur atom share electron figured formula reason cool reactor rid radiation dont rid cool down fusion idea happen make isotope and magnetic alignment when electron align field release photon stop electron proton release bit radiation radiation once defeating purpose qustion proton asorbing releasing photon wrong particle isnt free electron proton nuclease couldnt move held togehter independant particle point nuclear reaction control rate fusion idea happen make isotope and magnetic alignment when electron align field release photon stop electron proton release bit radiation radiation once defeating purpose question proton adsorbing releasing photon wrong particle isnt free electron proton nuclease couldnt move held independent particle point nuclear reaction control rate frequency radiation released jerry rig solar panel pick radiation make energy radiation light solar panel light photon idea share wrote email pump photon electron start higher shell higher shell atom compensate electron seperate atom pull proton laser fission reaction emc fusion reation opposite instead creating energy creating mass drawing energy mass adding energy mass adding photon electron jump higher shell nucleous atom balanced anymore wanting bring particle where question field field strenght compared amp ideas havard talked mri concept experimented with point tesla traded amp particle magnetic which shown example device mix polarity create nuclear reaction energy dismissing law thermaldynamic subject ill later ive
