Wastes remain a major consideration whether they are released to the environment or not. Ethical principles seem increasingly likely to influence energy policy in many countries, which augurs well for nuclear energy. The competitive position of nuclear energy \"is robust from a sustainable development perspective since most health and environmental costs are already internalised.\" 1 Until about 30 years ago,
