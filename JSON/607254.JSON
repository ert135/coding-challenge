Wilcke & Ho-Cheol Kim Posted 26 Feb 2016 | 17:00 GMT Illustration: Elias Stein Proposition: Electric cars will remain mostly niche products until they have a range of 800 kilometers, or roughly 500 miles, with an affordable battery. That’s as far as most people would want to drive in a day, and then they have all night to recharge.
