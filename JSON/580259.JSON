A fuel cell produces electrical power by combining hydrogen and oxygen to form a water by-product. The electrical power is used to charge a battery, which in turn, is used to power an electric motor controlled by a motor driver. The battery, the motor, and the motor driver generate heat, which is captured by water brought in thermal contact with these heat-generating component","m_szDocBody":"vehicle fuel cell system
