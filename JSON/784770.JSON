for controlling operation of a vehicle United States Patent 8855845 Abstract: A method of controlling operational modes of a hybrid electric vehicle includes: determining whether an all-electric range (AER) of the vehicle is at or less than a first predetermined value; activating a first operational mode if the AER is determined to be at or less than the first predetermined value; determining, while the first operational mode is active, whether the AER of the vehicle is greater than a second predetermined value; activating a second operational mode if the AER is determined
