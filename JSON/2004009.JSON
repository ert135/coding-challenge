This is part 2 of 2. Read part 1 here . There are pressing reasons why innovation funding needs to move beyond its current tech-centric approach (as explained in part 1 ). Most important, economies grappling with deep de-carbonization — such as Germany and California — have made it clear that our suite of clean energy policies is no longer sufficient and may be counterproductive. Deeper emission cuts require policy resets.  Bill Gates has ","m_szDocBody":"way strengthen bill gate energy innovation push wednesday shutterstock frederic legrand comeo bill gate paris part read
