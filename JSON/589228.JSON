This method of cracking ammonia using relatively cheap sodium rather than an expensive catalyst could pave the","m_szDocBody":"hydrogen breakthrough pave ammoniafuelled car british scientistshave proposed making easier cheaper run hydrogen fuelcell vehicle filling ammonia researcher developed cut cost making hydrogen ammonia transported stored easily hydrogen tank similar filling station liquid petroleum gas lpg method cracking ammonia cheap sodium expensive catalyst pave fuelcell vehicle make hydrogen widely chemical carrying tank highpressure hydrogen requiring expensive infrastructure alternatively combining small amount hydrogen rest ammonia enable burned optimised conventional internal combustion engine ice researcher isis neutron source facility oxfordshireclaim major car manufacturer planning launch commercial hydrogen fuelcell vehicle year including toyota honda general motor major fear difficulty creating hydrogen fuel infrastructure perceived danger potentially explosive gas principle investigator martin owen jone left prof bill david ammonia decomposition reactor prof bill david research team isis built proofofconcept reactor ammonia stored lower pressure atmosphere typically store hydrogen vehicle store ammonia atmosphere straightforward store forecourt told engineer youve equivalent lpg tank forecourt dont worry expensive hydrogen infrastructure added ammoniafuelled ice efficient current engine design ammonias performance good petrol diesel ballpark reckon easily mile gallon tank ammonia range youre electric car idea solution current method producing hydrogen ammonia rely precious metal catalyst ruthenium temperature isis solution recorded british chemist arthur titherley react ammonia sodium produce sodium amide break nitrogen hydrogen original sodium reaction require temperature lower needed catalystbased reaction constant flow ammonia small amount heated time making conventionally sized car battery start process ammonia world widely produced inorganic chemical conventionally manufactured hydrocarbon biogas hydrogen made renewable energy offer lowcarbon alternative david admitted converting hydrogen ammonia back created inefficiency storing fuel large amount energy compress make hydrogen compact ammonia way said ammoniaburning vehicle bus created belgium ammoniafuelled car built recent year notably adapted toyota sport car produced italian tyre firm marangoni david advantage turning ammonia hydrogen made easier combust fuel reduced expensive catalyst prof robert steinbergerwilcken chair hydrogen fuel cell research university birmingham sodium ammonia place hydrogen increase weight fuel factor four weight highpressure hydrogen tank solution work small portable application told engineer email doubt extra energy required producing ammonia cracking temperature justified application requiring larger flow hydrogen isis neutron source operated science technology facility council enabled researcher prove exact nature chemical reaction taking place ammonia reacted sodium produce hydrogen research published today american chemical ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.theengineer.co.uk/hydrogen-breakthrough-paves-way-for-ammonia-fuelled-cars/","m_Places":["Toyota","Belgium"],"m_People":["Honda","Martin Owen Jones","Bill David","Arthur Titherley","David","Marangoni","Robert Steinberger"],"m_Companies":["General Motors","Diesel","University Of Birmingham","Science And Technology Facilities Council","Journal Of The American Chemical Society"],"m_BiGrams":["fuelcell vehicle","hydrogen ammonia"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":369}
