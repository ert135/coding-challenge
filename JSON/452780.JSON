Apple and Mac News By: Xennex1170 Wouldn't that matter only for the components that come in contact with the hydrogen. Mainly the storage, transport and fuel cell and would have no effect on other components of the car? By: Xennex1170 There is an abundance of sugar.. Maybe there is a way to convert that to hydrogen over using fossil fuels. By: Karsten @sherm66 Where does the hydrogen come from the fuel cell vehicles? A fuel cell vehicle consumes per Mile 3-4 times as much energy. Is this profitable?
