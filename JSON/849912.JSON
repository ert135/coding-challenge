Its first commercial nuclear power reactor began operating in 1985. Government commitment to the future of nuclear energy is strong. Plans for new nuclear capacity are stalled, but policy calls for a substantial increase by 2040. In 2013, 87.1 TWh was generated, of which 44.2 TWh was from coal, 30.7 TWh (35.3%) from nuclear, with net exports of 17 TWh a . Capacity in 2012 was 20.4 GWe.
