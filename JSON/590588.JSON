Genex Power has unveiled plans to build a 150MW solar PV project at the old Kidston gold mine in Queensland, siting it adjacent to a proposed 330MW pumped hydro storage project. If it goes ahead, it will be the biggest solar plant (although it may face some competition from competing proposals), but certainly the largest combined solar and storage project in the Australia, and a world first on the latter metric. “The development at the Kidston site will offer fringe of grid renewable energy generation and storage in","m_szDocBody":"gile parkinson originally published reneweconomy genex power unveiled plan build solar project kidston gold mine queensland siting adjacent proposed pumped hydro storage project ahead biggest solar plant although face competition competing proposal largest combined solar storage project australia world firston metric development kidston offer fringe grid renewable energy generation storage north queensland net energy importer listed company statement developed genex believe integrated scheme open large part northern queensland future development kidston significant centralised energy hub proposal number proposed north queensland including unique hybrid proposal made windlab kennedy energy park large scale solar project frv solar choice other large scale solar project boosted tender announced ergon energy capacity solar storage commissioned queensland government origin energy keen develop solar project region genex kidston solar project constructed top existing kidston mine tailing storage facility kidston site ly west wise mine pit part proposed pump storage facility genex area excellent solar resource solar plant annual capacity factor cent fixedangle solar panel estimate cent energy produced higher power demand period capacity factor highest country potential increase capacity factor solar tracking system investigated part project feasibility studymanaging directormichael addison said whilst kidston pumped storage project remain principal focus tailing storage facility kidston present obvious ideal solar generation platform addison project depend power purchase agreement local utility consumer hinted seek funding solar funding initiative market mean australian renewable energy agency clean energy finance corporation tender pursued ergon energy queensland government genex commissioned aecom conduct full feasibility study solar project share transmission line planned pumped hydro storage project reprinted permission youd attend cleantechnica solar event date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter ","m_szGeo1":"Australia","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2015/10/12/genex-power-plans-worlds-first-solar-pv-plant-pumped-hydro-storage-project/","m_Places":["Queensland","Australia","Northern"],"m_People":["Giles Parkinson","Genex Power","Michael Addison","Addison","Aecom"],"m_Companies":["Energy Agency","Finance Corporation"],"m_BiGrams":["solar project","storage project","storage facility","capacity factor"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,4,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":279}
