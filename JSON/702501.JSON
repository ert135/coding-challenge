report written widely circulated participant revised shawna waugh lot writing talked yesterday beginning convinced report file drawer again however turn mary graph consideration weekly survey natural gas storage issue fast turnaround survey suddenly relevant again meeting yesterday people made reference lesson learned document turned good exercise recommendation develop data requirement early existing survey possible respondent report them parallel sequentially time time afford fast turnaround turned helpful new asa fellowship approved solicitation shortly encourage apply distribute colleague apply fellowship bit later andy kyde talk experience fellow year new data definition team completed work sound lot worked year chairperson crawford major kirkendall yes talked time past guess lot work long period time perseverance major piece this wrote definition task lot definition definition term slight difference major difference tackled project wrote consolidated definition term wrote definition widely circulated eia comment input buyin achieved that definition implemented survey form web web soon them put procedure address issue future end standard this worked national energy information centre tackle followon project consistent definition remaining term scope project end result distant future year consistent set definition big new recently omb issued federal notice

easier focus quality manage requirement agency guideline draught form final form year talking this jay casselberry tomorrow finally changed process changing website make information asa energy committee available energy event meeting date point contact public website add link people bit asa energy committee bit detailed agenda showing topic discussed meeting over course replace announcement meeting people time date provide summary recommendation committee received summary meeting well month month half ago meeting prepare summary session recommendation committee eia plan reviewed blessed everybody make publicly website provide public indication committee yet shortly end remark question chairperson crawford yes couple question calvin kent supposed write history asa committee know started mission was committee member previous chair that continuing sort fallen crack busy person life kirkendall heard heard anything bill weinig kirkendall mean perfect put general information chairperson crawford well intention meeting page anything thought well know draught something calvin give history and know outcome previous meeting cheque see know status ifs completed planning kirkendall yes great burton carol cheque him chairperson crawford okay you great put action item great question summary recommendation evolve time meeting beginning sort put everyone comment kirkendall process bill put basically abstract talk eia person responsible talk add thought committee recommendation summary action were pretty completed what june weinig kirkendall kind languished review purpose turned faster review needed review needed reviewed broadly quickly work point send start adding committee committee add committee comment input chairperson crawford guess point view conjunction planning preparing meeting kirkendall bad timing chairperson crawford yes recall thing call recall error sooner better mean meeting time march bit earlier usual think easter fall year that preparation meeting kirkendall bill input eia people involved send summary asa people involved session particular chair approval piece early earlier else okay you chairperson crawford you andy ready

question fast accurate natural gas talking earlier valuable eia put day initial estimate production based vast knowledge here paid source pay day after day estimate finalfinal know lot rough number rough number natural gas care care away else minus percent minus ten else hutzler okay list needed real timely basis give accuracy versus opposite hear mark answer too burton well guess point send list send one too cross purpose data way necessarily user guidance this served professional judgement people data best hutzler agree you judgement decision people data best input user mark bernstein impact data has back natural gas data out impact future market price eia job putting data faster market work efficiently storage data production data watching carefully market past year half aga report price swing down know false report and know driving nut perfect responsibility government step job give list important impact have necessarily use lot impact price market that stuff put faster rough hutzler else opinion this hengartner mean tend agree mark oldfashioned thinking government paying eia cut mean term making prediction policy purpose put emphasis financial market simply spain end day stability financial market important production level know mean live percent error mean percent error making time give confidence interval statistician give percent error hutzler interesting well project call tcf project mean percent demand supply both well both combination you okay hengartner direction off yes number morning saw underestimate example systematically factor happy cowing actually definition statistician person expect wrong percent time hengartner percent error acceptable hutzler okay randy think sitter that customer state correctly tradeoff accuracy timeliness customer interested stability market accept percent interested social trend end year accurate estimate basically information customer agree that professional government agency bottom line hutzler okay tom cowing well answer slightly different nonquantitative way question analysing else data specific item general answer anything information person say well know throw while people number use real bind lose million dollar month spend half million know equivalent data source knowing good kind information hard quantify useful hutzler roy whitmore guess agree general philosophy drive policy and secondly earlier estimate make market stable direct benefit entire country accurate estimate early estimate order achieve goal making market stable guess term accurate idea available feel that help source poor information place invest resource stabilise market hutzler carol chairperson crawford interested list mark produce see odd burton expect are make point user chairperson crawford good point interesting commonality have nicholas comment guess agree statistical thing percent error acceptable eia data depending used gut instinct bit large sophisticated way propagated model know client buy know model regressed forecasted time operation error bigger bigger hengartner smoothed chairperson crawford okay depending philosophy have guess nicholas intend sort give licence say percent something gut reaction there hengartner give error error statistician confidence interval mean actually giving number give range love say well listen give number give range acknowledge fact number precise satisfy end user would bernstein client hengartner give range eia give range week month important value stabilise market information commercially available great cowing actually giving range send false sense accuracy hengartner doe saying give range cowing people percent error all chairperson crawford well idea range acceptable end user oftentime attach minus uncertainty behind mean people grab estimate run leave measure uncertainty behind range bit difficult that hengartner actually question customer happy range term quality measure that give range number work sitter published number range number now mean talking public differently accurate hutzler preliminary result sitter yes know agree you problem bernstein talking public either talking talking people company institution information reason general public sitter yes know understand mean suggest information trust eia trust place right not stated number range hutzler hear jay breidt yes room remind people that statistician talk percent talking probability missed true value confidence interval opposed width minus percent lot comment evolving idea sort vote end user important timeliness accuracy mention range well good idea force number range midpoint acknowledge uncertainty that bernstein tom point howard magnas question year state energy worked researcher data basically said well stuff eia provide
