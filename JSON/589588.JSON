While we’re going to continue to find more, we will eventually run out. This leads to many companies thinking about what the future will be and how they will play a part in it. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are one path forward, but until energy generation becomes efficient enough that we can manage it on a local scale, we’re going to be relying on the grid to power our vehicles ( and vice versa ).
