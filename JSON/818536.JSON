Try to think of something that doesn't involve energy and you won't get very far. Even thinking—even thinking about energy!—needs some energy to make it happen. In fact, everything that happens in the world uses energy of one kind or another. But what exactly is energy? Energy is a bit of a mystery. Most of the time we can't see it, yet it is everywhere around us. Revving car engines burn energy, hot cups of coffee hold energy, street lights that shine at night are using energy, sleeping dogs are using energy too—absolutely everything you","m_szDocBody":"tweet
