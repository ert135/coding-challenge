[0016] The flex fuel engine 12 drives a generator (not separately shown but part of engine 12 in FIGS. 1 and 3 ) with sufficient output power to drive the electric motor 20 and charge the swappable battery pack 22. Such a generator is known and is used in the Chevy Volt prototype. The generator of the Chevy Volt outputs 53 kilowatts and is driven by a four cylinder engine.
