Credit: Murali Raju, Penn State The honeycomb structure of pristine graphene is beautiful, but Northwestern University scientists, together with collaborators from five other institutions, have discovered that if the graphene naturally has a few tiny holes in it, you have a proton-selective membrane that could lead to improved fuel cells. A major challenge in fuel cell technology is efficiently separating protons fr","m_szDocBody":"imperfect graphene open door fuel cell proton transfer channel quaddefect graphene obtained reaxff molecular dynamic simulation credit murali raju penn state honeycomb structure pristine graphene beautiful northwestern university scientist collaborator institution discovered graphene naturally tiny hole protonselective membrane lead improved fuel cell major challenge fuel cell technology efficiently separating proton hydrogen study singlelayer graphene water northwestern researcher found slightly imperfect graphene shuttle protonsand protonsfrom side graphene membrane mere second membrane speed selectivity conventional membrane offering engineer simpler mechanism fuel cell design imagine electric car charge time take fill car gas chemist franz geiger led research and yetimagine electric car hydrogen fuel fossil fuel ethanol electricity power grid charge battery surprising discovery electrochemical mechanism make day defective singlelayer graphene turn out produce membrane world thinnest proton channelonly atom thick found dial graphene back perfection membrane want geiger professor chemistry weinberg college art science everyone strive make pristine graphene data show proton through perfect graphene hydroxylated defect facile proton transfer pristine singlelayer graphene substrate credit university minnesota study published nature communication geiger research team included collaborator northwestern oak ridge national laboratory university virginia university minnesota pennsylvania state university university puerto rico atomic world aqueous solution proton pretty big scientist driven single layer chemically perfect graphene room temperature graphene form elemental carbon composed single flat sheet carbon atom arranged repeating hexagonal honeycomb lattice video load shortly video simulation transport process geiger colleague studied graphene exposed water found proton moving graphene cuttingedge laser technique imaging method computer simulation set learn how researcher discovered naturally occurring defect graphenewhere carbon atom missingtrigger chemical merrygoround proton water side membrane shuttled side second advanced computer simulation showed occur classic bucketline mechanism proposed hydroxylated defect facile proton transfer pristine singlelayer graphene substrate credit credit university minnesota thinness atomthick graphene make quick trip proton geiger said conventional membrane hundred nanometer thick proton selection take minutesmuch long practical next research team asked question carbon atom knock graphene layer proton move through handful square micron area graphene researcher calculated video load shortly advanced theoretical simulation track dynamic proton transfer network interconnected hydrogen bond centre defect graphene surface credit credit university minnesota removing carbon atom result highly reactive start proton shuttling process proton tiny hole making membrane selective conventional membrane selective our result make fuel cell tomorrow mechanism engineer design proton separation membrane complicated people thought before geiger said all slightly imperfect singlelayer graphene ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://phys.org/news/2015-03-graphene-membrane-fuel-cells-filters.html","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Franz M.
