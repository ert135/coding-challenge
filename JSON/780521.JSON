As early as the seventeenth century, fluorspar was found to emit light when heated, and gave its name to the fluorescence phenomenon. In 1886, the French chemist Henri Moissan electrolysed a solution of KHF2 in anhydrous HF and obtained a gas that caused crystalline silicon to burst in flames. He immediately reported his results to the French Academy of Sciences with the following words: “One can indeed make various hyp","m_szDocBody":"inorganic chemistry fluorine derive fluorspar fluorite caf pictured earlier time flux facilitate smelting early seventeenth century fluorspar found emit light heated gave fluorescence phenomenon french chemist henri moissan electrolysed solution khf anhydrous obtained gas caused crystalline silicon burst flame immediately reported result french academy science word make hypothese nature liberated gas simplest presence fluorine moissan awarded nobel prize chemistry discovery fluor fluorine chemistry developed rapidly world war american scientist working manhattan project separate fissionable uranium uranium uranium nature isotope abundance respectively similar property difficult separate volatility uranium hexafluoride turned key discovery separation current gaseous diffusion centrifuge processe enrich uranium rely slight mass difference isotope uranium hexafluoride ensuring technology proliferate today key political issue synthese shown kmnf sbf preparation elemental fluorine largely based pioneering work moissan industrial scale main elemental fluorine production dielectric medium electric device number metal fluoride unusually oxidation state auf agf nif nif hgf synthesised recent year strong oxidising agent milestone chemistry achieved fluorine discovery reactivity noble gase xenon fluoride prepared neil bartlett challenged generally accepted noble gase inert led preparation extended number noble gas fluoride derivative fluoride krypton radon owing small atomic size covalent behaviour substitution hydrogen oxygen fluorine organic molecule result large number compound interesting nature featuring stable covalent carbonfluorine bond bestknown widespread teflon polytetrafluoroethylene nonstick cooking pan stable carbonfluorine bond enormous success design pharmacologically active molecule length bond dissimilar stability powerful electronwithdrawing property give rise desirable property drug design organofluorine safely risk releasing toxic fluoride example aromatic ring fluorinated para position metabolised enzyme body poisonous epoxide currently pharmaceutical product agrochemical compound fluorine proportion rising organofluorine highly toxic monofluoroacetic acid example lethal human oral dose disruption citric acid cycle important energy supply cell moreover chlorofluorocarbon cfc extensively refrigerator aerosol owing extreme kinetic stability atmosphere proved catastrophic stratosphere leading depletion ozone layer recent development fluorine chemistry include perfluorocarbon hydrofluoroether liquidliquid extraction separation catalyst fluorinated tag cyclopentadienyl titaniumtrifluoride cptif cme derivative effective catalyst polymerization styrene cptif catalyst time active chlorinated counterpart lower cocatalysttocatalyst ratio versus chlorinated system industrial use activity low cocatalysttocatalyst ratio tremendous cost reduction finally returning fluorspar compound type lcaf where diketiminate ligand prepared contrast fluorspar soluble organic solvent intermediate cover surface caf coating transparent visible light resistant acid base fluorine compound key role electric car electronic device space technology pharmaceutical disastrous effect scientist working field alert ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_academic","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v2/n3/full/nchem.569.html","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Henri Moissan","Neil Bartlett"],"m_Companies":["French Academy","Indeed","Fluor","American Scientists"],"m_BiGrams":[],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":381}
