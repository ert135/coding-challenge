Yale Environment 360 : Surprising new statistics show that the world economy is expanding while global carbon emissions remain at the same level. Is it possible that the elusive ‘decoupling’ of emissions and economic growth could be happening? Heliostats at the Ivanpah solar thermal plant in California’’s Mojave desert. The biggest cause of decoupling is the dramatic growth of renewable energy.
