Mining is the extraction of minerals and elements of economic interest from the earth's surface. As the demand for natural resources increases, the amount of material in mineral deposits decreases.  An increase in price of these materials allows companies to continue to profit from mining deposits with lower ore grades. Mining and subsequent processing of strategic elements can be harmful to the environment. As lower ore grades start to be mined, we must be more and more conscious of waste and habitat destruction in order to minimize the envi","m_szDocBody":"mining mining current mining yield sustainable
