There are plenty of discussions of hydrogen and ethanol economies       and electric cars operating on long life       batteries, none of which are likely to be economical on a large scale       within the next 20 years, and yet almost no talk about the only viable       alternative       to oil today. And no, t","m_szDocBody":"scott miller methanol alcohol irony environmental movement talk hype renewable energy source hear oldest versatile renewable methanol plenty discussion hydrogen ethanol
