By this hybrid power system, intermittent sources can be integrated in power generation without compromising the reliability of the grid and without long power line connections. Carbon dioxide becomes, in effect, a storage medium for energy produced by intermittent sources. The CO2 can be pipelined to sites where wind, solar, tidal or and ot","m_szDocBody":"hybrid power cracking power plant power wind solar intermittent energy source crack carbon dioxide nox sox emission
