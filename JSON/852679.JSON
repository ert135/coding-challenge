TAP have now released a technical white paper which provides greater detail about their reactor concept. The paper reveals that their 520MWe MSR concept makes use of a zirconium hydride moderator combined with a lithium fluoride fuel salt. This innovative combination would enable the reactor to run on spent nuclear fuel, or fresh low-enriched u","m_szDocBody":"transatomic power publishes detail msr concept posted david martin back
