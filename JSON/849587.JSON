Its first commercial nuclear power reactor began operating in 1968. A new uranium mining project is commencing. Government commitment to the future of nuclear energy in Spain has been uncertain, but has firmed up as the cost of subsidising renewables becomes unaffordable. Electricity consumption in Spain had been increasing steadily until 2008 but has since levelled off, and in 2012 it declined 1.9% due to Spain's economic recession. Per capita it is about 5200 kWh/yr.
