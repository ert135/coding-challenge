The last time I heard him say those words was during an interview by Katie Couric just a couple of weeks ago. Web denizens, Navy submariners, former Army Nukes, and others have always recognized that the former Vice President’s comment does not provide a full picture of the possibilities. While it is certainly true that vendors like GE, Areva, Rosatom,","m_szDocBody":"rod adam gore frequently sound bite explain scepticism potential nuclear power address energy climate change challenge
