It’s exciting to see wind power at such a low price, but it’s been there for awhile, and solar power has been much more expensive for awhile, so it’s really exciting to see utility-scale solar getting as cheap as gas combined cycle power plants (and cheaper than coal or nuclea","m_szDocBody":"lcoe utilityscale solar power competitive zachary shahan shared chart extremely low cost wind power reader dashed redlineinserted click chart clearly exciting wind power low price awhile solar power expensive awhile exciting utilityscale solar cheap gas combined cycle power plant and cheaper coal nuclear energy course cleantechnica reader weve extremely low solar power price mexico texas minnesota beating lowpriced natural gas report showing lcoe utilityscale solar power beating natural gas coal nuclear power something carried cost wholesale electricity however important note rooftop solar power doesnt typically compete wholesale electricity price rather compete retail electricity price rooftop solar cheaper option hundred million people let remember that scale cost natural gas coal nuclear power include massive externality make expensive solar wind power related storey cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag cost solar lazard lcoe lcoe solar zachary shahan tryin and specy letter time spend time cleantechnica director chief editor otherwise enthusiastically fulfilling duty obsession gas solar love planetsave bikocity president important media zach recognised globally solar energy electric car energy storage wind energy expert speak related conference event connect social media zacharyshahancom related post wind solar cheaper fossil nuclear bobwallace warranty indicative actual performance simply guarantee minimum car routinely mile warranty operate problem bobwallace performance loss number solar panel high nrel determined panel manufactured year range loss make worst case high snow load loss original output year case original year lcoe standard comparing cost power source similar period time decision build made analysis detailed residual value earning past year window play marion mead way year solar panel degraded efficiency installation cost investment cost needing inverter beat efficiency original michael wind touted lcoe cheapest form fine print graphic lot doesnt count transmission build cost storage cost wind alley run centre country west texas western dakota population centre get problem texas built transmission infrastructure wind farm came expensive slow coast utility legitimately argue wind energy offshore wind cost onshore wind also true wind investment tax credit matter much jeffhre nuclear gas coal installation count cost transmission build out contingency reserve spinning reserve secure grid thermal plant failure west coast wind alley power connecting existing transmission asset utah california iirc idaho also solar power time expensive fossil fuel power vein shore wind continue drop price offshore wind add value grid extend effect time production distributed resiliency effect lowering price overall bobwallace transmission storage backup part lcoe calculation involved cost generating power factor play purchaser decide purchase excellent offshore wind close people live oceanic offshore great lake offer great resource point wind competitive subsidy subsidy speed rate installation make wind bigger bargain remember faster instal wind faster close coal plant limited term investment wind save trillion health cost coal pollution air lung external cost mined land reclamation coal collected tonne basis problem quick switch renewable distributed power waste management mining company simply bankrupt utility disband fossil fuel nuke trust underfunded external cost recovery health environmental impact argued court couple generation bobwallace external cost mined land reclamation coal collected tonne basis understanding abandoned uranium mine cleaned tax payer money ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/10/26/lcoe-utility-scale-solar-power-getting-really-competitive/","m_Places":["New Mexico , Texas","Minnesota","Best","United States","West Texas","Texas","Utah","California","Idaho"],"m_People":["Zachary Shahan","Marion Meads"],"m_Companies":["Lazard","Fossils","Indicative","Us West","Great Lakes","Those Limited","Waste Management"],"m_BiGrams":["solar power","utilityscale solar","wind power","coal nuclear","natural gas","gas coal","electric car","wind energy","offshore wind","external cost"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":530}
