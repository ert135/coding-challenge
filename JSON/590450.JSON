By Daniel Thomas Business reporter 4 December 2015 From the section Business Image copyright Solar Reserve Image caption The Crescent Dunes plant can deliver more than 500,000 megawatt hours of electricity per year It could be a scene from a science fiction movie. Deep in the Nevada desert, thousands of mirrors arrayed in concentric circles face the sky, lit up by the sun. All this reflected sunshine is directed to the top of a 640 ft (195m) tower standing in their midst.
