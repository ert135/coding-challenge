Published in the journal Science, the results of the researchers’ study shows how they adapted a technology originally intended for solar energy in order to selectively remove the radioactive chemical element americium from nuclear waste pools. “In order to solve the nuclear waste problem, you have to solve the americium problem,” said To","m_szDocBody":"researcher crack yearold nuclear waste
