For timely updates, follow John Farrell on Twitter or get the Democratic Energy weekly update. For states looking to reduce their reliance on dirty, imported energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory brings good news on the wind. In a May 2015 report, significantly more wind power potential was found in nearly every state thanks to advancing turbine technology. In 2015, 40 states could produce 50% or more of their annual electricity use from","m_szDocBody":"rising wind tech mean greater state wind potential john farrell originally posted ilsrorg timely
