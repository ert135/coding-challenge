Cohen presents in this paper his point of view as an independant university researcher, into the advantages of nuclear power vis-a-vis other energy options. I          must begin with an apology for the fact that this paper is          written from the standpoint of an American citizen.  All of my research has been based on U.S. as a \"laboratory\",          using U.S. statistics and U.S> experience and          practices.  Hopefully, much of it i","m_szDocBody":"nuclear power advantage nuclear energy avert environmental consequence arising fossil fuel
