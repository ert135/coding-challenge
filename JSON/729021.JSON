Retail prices are not comparable due to taxes and fees added at the retail level. I can’t find a comparison of wholesale prices at the moment, but look down a couple of comments and you’ll see a graph of German wholesale electricity prices.  They’re under 4 euro cents per kWh. The French government recently released information that their production cost of electricity from their nuclear plants was EUR 59.8/MWh or 6 euro cents per kWh. http:/","m_szDocBody":"bobwallace
