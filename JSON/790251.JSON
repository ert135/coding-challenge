Coli and a phosphate storage molecule found in seeds, British researchers have found. They used the common bacteria with a chemical parallel of what is already found in agricultural waste: inositol phosphate. Inositol phosphate is insoluble, so it forms a precipitate on the bacteria. The E. Coli then broke down the precipitate; releasing the phosphate molecules which then attached to ","m_szDocBody":"agricultural waste clean nuclear waste researcher susan kraemer waste uranium apparently recovered cheaply polluted runoff uranium mining coli phosphate storage molecule found seed british researcher found common bacteria chemical parallel found agricultural waste inositol phosphate inositol phosphate insoluble form precipitate bacteria coli broke precipitate releasing phosphate molecule attached uranium molecule form uranium phosphate harvested recover uranium developed contaminant clean another lynne macaskie university birmingham led research radioactive water presented finding general microbiology meeting heriotwatt university edinburgh interestingly uranium mining industry produce significant amount uranium waste nuclear plant process effective waste uranium nuclear power production researcher claim energy security health risk source worth cleaning process developed extremely cheap similar technique invented expensive effective macasky process time effective cheaper cost gramme recover uranium technique cent gramme cheapest source inositol phosphate price uranium itself potential customer top uranium producer canada australia kazakhstan country interested germany czech republic france latter nuclear plant themselve united state mine small amount uranium par niger namibia uzbekistan russia russia lot nuclear waste told cheap feedstock easily obtained plant waste shown economic scalable process uranium recovery possible agricultural pollution clean nuclear waste live strange time cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag agricultural waste coli inositol phosphate lynne macaskie nuclear waste cleanup radioactive water general microbiology university birmingham uranium waste susan kraemer write cleantechnica csptoday renewable energy world published wind energy update solar plaza earthtechling pvinsider greenprophet ecoseed nrdc onearth matternetwork celsius energynow scientific american serial entrepreneur product design susan bring innovator perspective inventing carbonconstrained civilization necessity mother invention solving climate change mother necessitiesas lover history scifi enjoy chronicling strange future creating interesting time follow susan related post ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2009/09/18/agricultural-waste-can-clean-up-nuclear-waste-researchers-find/","m_Places":["Uk","Edinburgh","Canada","Australia","Kazakhstan","Germany","Czech Republic","France","United States","Niger","Namibia","Uzbekistan","Russian Federation"],"m_People":["Susan Kraemer","Lynne Macaskie"],"m_Companies":["University Of Birmingham","Society For General Microbiology","Heriot-watt University","Scientific American","Twitter"],"m_BiGrams":["nuclear waste","inositol phosphate","agricultural waste"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[4,4,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":297}
