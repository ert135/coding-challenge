This distance is roughly the same as traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle. How long does it take to cover the 1,100 miles in China? Looks like about 7 hours , which would be much faster than driving and far less stressful. Even the old, slow train took about 16 hours, so 7 is a huge improvement. In 2012, a high-speed rail route from Beijing to Guangzhou also opened, covering over 1,400 miles i","m_szDocBody":"mile speed
