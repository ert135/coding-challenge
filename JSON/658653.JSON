They're expensive to run and emit pollution and greenhouse gases. Even people who don't rely entirely on generators use Australia's power grid, which is mostly fuelled by polluting, climate-altering coal. Now, one company is showing that supplying Australia's energy needn't be expensive or polluting. AllGrid Energy produces 10 kilowatt-hour solar-power batteries that take advantage of Australia's abundant sunlight and growing demand","m_szDocBody":"energy storage renewable jumpstart david suzuki enlarge remote australian community diesel generator power expensive run emit pollution greenhouse gase people rely generator australias power grid fuelled polluting climatealtering coal now company showing supplying australias energy neednt expensive polluting allgrid energy produce kilowatthour solarpower battery advantage australias abundant sunlight growing demand solar panel leadacid gel battery expensive teslas lithium powerwall australia allgrid system sold indigenous community providing affordable energy independence rapid pace renewable energy development clear hurdle previously confronting cleanenergy technology variable nature advantage fossil fuel source storage energy renewable wind solar source argue solar wind energy work sun shine wind blow output vary cloud cover wind speed factor replace large baseload source coal oil gas nuclear battery energy storage method powergrid improvement make renewable competitive fossil fuel nuclear power term reliability efficiency affordability storage grid technology advancing daily renewable energy easily quickly replace fossil fuelgenerated electricity canada ontarios independent electricity system operator contracted company test number storage system including battery hydrogen storage kinetic flywheel thermal system store heat special brick ontario aiming cent installed generating capacity renewable source main renewableenergy storage method thermal compressed air hydrogen pumped hydroelectric flywheel battery large scale small scale electric car popular battery connected grid supply balance power offset cost owner harvard university researcher working flow battery abundant inexpensive organic compound called quinone expensive metal renewable energy storage number advantage fossil fuel discharge power grid meet demand quickly efficiently prone disruption power source distributed large area part knocked storm example part system running fossil fuel nuclear power system require lot water cooling affected drought nuclear power system expensive long time build cleanenergy technology create job fossil fuel development renewable pollute create greenhouse gas emission lower cost healthcare everincreasing impact climate change energy source consequence damage risk mining processing transporting coal oil bitumen uranium fracking extraction method greater clean energy fossil fuel eventually run out increasingly expensive difficult obtain ridden conflict scarcity grow rapid storagetechnology development place renewable source forefront global energy mix coming year renewable deployed storage recent report showed reduce emission electricity sector cent relative level year with current technology electrical storage study scientist national oceanic atmospheric administration university colorado boulderand published nature climate change concluded grid improvement including highvoltage directcurrent transmission grid deliver lowcost clean energy country match supply demand still storage offer advantage urgent cut greenhouse gas emission government provide incentive rapid renewable energy development deployment quickly computer technology human invention advanced easy barrier cleanenergy shift political psychological technological david suzuki scientist broadcaster cofounder david suzuki foundationwritten contribution david suzuki foundation senior editor ian hanington ","m_szGeo1":"Australia","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/energy-storage-gives-renewables-a-jump-start/Content?oid=2748867","m_Places":["Australia","Tesla","Canada , Ontario","Ontario","United States","Boulder"],"m_People":["David Suzuki","Ian Hanington"],"m_Companies":["Diesel","Rapid","Independent Electricity System Operator","Harvard University","National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration","University Of Colorado","David Suzuki Foundation"],"m_BiGrams":["fossil fuel","david suzuki","renewable energy","energy storage","nuclear power"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,4,4,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":423}
