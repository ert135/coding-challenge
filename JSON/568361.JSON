Rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector is now possible wit","m_szDocBody":"robbie orvis michael oboyle hallie kennan energy innovation americas electric system stark inflexion point coal power plant operating alltime low growing retirement natural gas price historical low power generation rising electricity sale flattening extreme weather event forcing resilient infrastructure plunging renewable energy price made low zerocarbon source costcompetitive conventional fuel source rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emission electricity sector radically disrupting grid operation cost reliability grid require substantial transformation rely higher share variable renewable generation critic argue technological financial institutional barrier prevent significant decarbonization electricity sector drive cost least common clean energy myth easily debunked fact experience show lowcarbon energy future sacrificing affordable reliable service myth natural gas generation main reason decrease carbon emission reality renewable energy energy efficiency played major role decline emission energy information administration data carbon dioxide emission peaked million metric tonne remained level year since coincident rise power sector natural gas capacity easy conclude transition dirty coal lessdirty natural gas biggest contributor decline however significant evidence show acceleration renewable energy energy efficiency contributed natural gas reducing carbon emission natural gas generation terrawatthour twh added nonhydro renewable approximately twh renewable generation produce essentially emission natural gas emit roughly half carbon dioxide coal doe mean added renewable generation impact natural gas reducing carbon dioxide emission replace coal factoring downstream emission natural gas combustion upstream methane leakage account natural gas bad climate coal thus addition renewable greater relative impact reducing emission energy efficiency has perhap greater contributor emission reduction natural gas renewable decade appliance equipment building technique enhanced consume power providing level improved performance major impact electricity use decreased electricity sale sizeable dip great recession rebounded economic recovery sale turned downward again continued strong economic growth utility efficiency programme tightened code standard efficiency effort reduced electricity demand twh estimated contributed third more total emission reduction date pulling accurately estimating cost electricity sector decarbonization undoubtedly difficult endeavour rapid cost decline myriad technology market operation nuance institutional inertia favouring outdated system cloud picture nevertheless increasingly clear today technology option successfully decarbonize electric sector order costeffectively achieve goal state country laid out policymaker information guide policymaking moreover today economy extraordinarily favourable investment renewable resource make leap policymaker avoid catastrophic climate effect low natural gas price proliferation energy efficiencytechnology utility bill low providing cushion early investment renewable resource cost money historic low encouraging renewable developer invest finally federal tax incentive solar wind power peak level avoiding common myth decarbonizing power sector guide analyst policymaker solution needed reach affordable reliable clean energy future cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag greenhouse gas emission methane leakage carbon emission eia energy information administration guest contributor many people publish number guest post expert large variety field contributor account special people related post ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2016/05/16/us-carbon-emissions-reductions-from-renewable-energy-efficiency-not-natural-gas/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IM-cleantechnica+%28CleanTechnica%29","m_Places":["America","United States"],"m_People":["Robbie Orvis","Hallie Kennan","Roles"],"m_Companies":["Energy Future","Energy Information Administration","Us Energy Information Administration"],"m_BiGrams":["natural gas","renewable energy","electricity sector","renewable generation","carbon emission","carbon dioxide","emission natural"],"m_TriGrams":["emission natural gas"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[12,3,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":472}
