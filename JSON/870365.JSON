Lewis Fulton and Marshall Miller, UCS Science Network , UCS                        | May 2, 2016, 11:33 am EDT It was exciting to be part of the discussion in Paris this past December when countries came together to make a renewed commitment to limit climate warming to two degrees or less, with each country committing to what it felt it can deliver. The United States, for its part, has committed to cutting CO2 by 26-28% by ","m_szDocBody":"hitting climate target electric truck deliver good ucs science network hitting climate target electric truck
