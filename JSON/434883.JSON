But how do we get them? Modularity. Cars can be modular in design, production and use. Making cars using modularity will change the car industry. Now a very vertical industry where a few huge companies sell just complete cars, carmaking can change to a horizontal industry where thousands of companies sell car modules. Carmaking can become like the computer industry—innovative, vibrant, profitable.
