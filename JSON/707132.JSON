The focus has been on long-term physical constraints, and not on the messy details of our response in the short-term. But our reaction to a diminishing flow of fossil fuel energy in the short-term will determine whether we transition to a sus","m_szDocBody":"declining fossil fuel supply energy trap declining fossil
