The electrolyte additive consists of a mixture of natural oil such as white mineral oil or a hydro cracked and treated oil with naphthenic oil, a zinc free rust and oxidation inhibitor and an ethylene-propylene copolymer. The electrolyte additive is placed above the plate cells in lead acid batteries having antimony to inhibit gassing and misting with an ancillary benefit of increasing performance and durability of the battery.
