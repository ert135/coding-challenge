investment future made word advanced innovation nuclear industry wrote innovation nuclear sector year ago apply fact today thinking innovation nuclear industry discussion centre future reactor design however narrow focus argument called advanced design required save industry imply today design good enough technology produce abundant economic reliable electricity low carbon safest earth today worth celebrating unusual supporter nuclear power idea advanced design magic sauce make nuclear great again futuristic thorium plant norwegian sery occupied recently meeting noted recently visited havana cuba newer technology car cuba stuck past cuban found way car running past original live newer relic fun dont expect driving car vintage fact car today basically operate similar manner part made year ago today car made material computer controlled efficient safer due year year innovation apply nuclear plant happened back people talked invested replace car individual transport advanced car meaning electric vehicle flying car make better thought ridiculous common nuclear keeping outdated plant like car operating shiny plant future ready deployment truth yes important research develop concept based specific need closing fuel cycle type fuel thorium case required continue evolve safety reliability economic continue focus effort improving innovating taking reactor design today making better car abundant technology nuclear plant extend kind fuel choose burn implementing mean large spectrum technology constantly developed industry moving forward great current commitment delivering nuclear promise advancing safety reliability economic performance initiative forward address falling price alternative generation option stated threeyear programme identify efficiency measure adopt practise technology solution improve operation reduce generation cost prevent premature reactor closure drive innovation extending live current reactor understanding material age year possibly year remote tooling reduce dose shorten outage technology control improve reliability require innovation build innovation method reduce construction time improve quality computer engineering tool modularization simple moving platform replace scaffolding innovation let forget commercial innovation innovative business model canada refurbishment build critical future industry success include model place russia working foreign customer way thought past work wont innovation messy take time continue move industry forward innovation apply reactor type today future support development future design expense making public current design hit date concerned industry risking importance government money advanced design hundred million dollar study design shut focus future back year great thing afford mindset nuclear stop world continue build gas plant renewable year alternative wind solar and frankly are world abundant low carbon economic reliable electricity replace coal meet energy hungry world meet wna target new nuclear plant mean building lot plant today waiting big decade two today nuclear technology continue move forward demonstrate technology future improvement continuing make project last celebrate achievement continue invest innovation choice continue better strength performance performance continue innovation day post comment ","m_szGeo1":"United
