By Peter Bronski and Mark Dyson The basic law of supply and demand says that as demand surges and/or as supply lags, prices go up. Nowhere have we seen that effect more acutely than with wholesale electricity prices through this exceptionally hot summer in the United States. From the Pacific Northwest to the Southwest to the Midwest to the East Coast, this summer—and especially August last month—was largely known for its widespread scorching heat .
