Researchers at Australia’s Queensland University of Technology are hot on the trail of a new energy storage concept that melds our two favorite next-millennium nanomaterials, graphene and carbon nanotubes, and combines them with the current gold standard in electric vehicle technology, which would be a lithium-ion battery. The end result would be an EV with extra souped-up energy storage integrated into its body panels, enabling it to charge much more quickly, and travel much farther, than current technology allows.
