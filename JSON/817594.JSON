Of the more than 20 million barrels/ day of oil used by the United States, about 45% is devoted to the production of motor gasoline. This has resulted in the growing energy security problem for our country due to an increasing dependence on imported oil from unstable regions. The large consumption of oil also is a major contributor to the nationâ€™s greenh","m_szDocBody":"position statement nuclear power strategy reduce oil import longterm threat energy sustainability energy security global environmental quality represented growing demand oil documented million day oil united state devoted production motor gasoline resulted growing energy security problem country due increasing dependence imported oil unstable region large consumption oil major contributor nation greenhouse gas emission level partial substitution electricity gasoline transportation fuel major impact energy security environmental quality improving energy sustainability posture nuclear power provide contribution economically large external opportunity cost increasing plugin hybrid electric vehicle phevs appear feasible mean beginning transition purpose position paper argue phevs adopted solution energy supply challenge indeed american nuclear favour broad intensive approach problem including study attractive alternative eventually contribute solutionfeasibility eventually determine option sustained argue phevs stand list good approaches problem based today technology typical mile daily usage car completely accomplished battery power commuting speed longer trip car seamlessly switches small gasoline engine operate ordinary hybrid range electricity course dependent specifi vehicle storage capacity battery used move plugin hybrid technology offer possibility smooth transition today oilbased system increasingly electricity substitute example onethird vehicle plugin hybrid practical goal reduce oil motor transportation today level sharply reducing oil import signifi reduction emission result electricity increase increased electricity make sense produced manner economical sustainable minimise emission environmental effect generating technology accomplish important goal including hydro wind solar fossil fuel carbon capture nuclear these clear practical approach capable economically providing large quantity additional electrical energy required nuclear power based today technology nuclear power demonstrated enviable safety record producing electricity competitive cost availability nuclear power shown sustainable thousand year implementation closed fuel cycle technology positioned support major increase electricity design lend construction large baseloaded plant suited nighttime demand recharging mwelectric plant built year support onethird current motor vehicle eeta large impractical number recognition important potential role nuclear power transportation strengthen ensure technology central building block secure sustainable energy future nation nuclear power strategy reduce oil import position statement communication outreach department north kensington ave grange park telephone nuclear power strategy reduce oil import position statement bibliography graham comparing benefit impact hybrid electric vehicle option electric power research institute report final report uhrig greenhouse gas emission gasoline hybridelectric hydrogenfueled vehicle proceeding climate change technology conference ottawa canada uhrig plugin hybrid vehicle drastically reduce petroleumbased fuel consumption emission bent tau beta vol xcvi spring ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_general","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps82.pdf","m_Places":["United States","Ottawa","Canada","Bent"],"m_People":[],"m_Companies":["Indeed","Energy Future","Outreach Department","555 North Kensington Ave","La Grange","Electric Power Research Institute"],"m_BiGrams":["nuclear power","reduce oil","oil import","plugin hybrid","position statement","power strategy","strategy reduce","energy security"],"m_TriGrams":["nuclear power strategy","power strategy reduce","strategy reduce oil","reduce oil import"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[8,4,4,4,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3,3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":382}
