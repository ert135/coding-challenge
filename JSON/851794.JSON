supporting case nuclear power debate rolling asked barry brook made passionate advocate nuclear power barry brook initially problem replacing fossil fuel looked hard renewable energy promoting strongly supporter renewable energy say quickly conclusion based system analyse wasnt enough fundamentally solve energy climate crisis make enough characterise argument briefly dont favour nuclear energy renewable energy ensure level playing field compete against paul comriethomson ian lowe objection youve made barry position here centre called base load power mentioned lot talk solar wind geothermal base load electricity exaggerated that ian lowe application require electricity clock aluminium smelter regard important provide huge public subsidy economic coal fired electricity melt aluminium competition icelandic geothermal canadian hydro steel work traffic light operate insomniac writer meet pantera presss unreasonable deadline that application require power oclock morning base load electricity artificially inflated year coal fired power station difficult ramp follow demand electricity industry encouraged energy wastefully early hour morning heating water radiate heat slowly day offpeak tarrif brought encourage people electricity night remember britain studying electricity industry marketed spaceheating technology called storage heater idea basically pile brick living room heater middle heater ran midnight brick slowly radiated rest day inefficient mean heating good electricity industry evened load current socalled base load artificially inflated reduced real base load easily met renewable geothermal wave energy basically paul comriethomson barry brook reply that principal position renewable wont work power wont deliver ian lowe amount power exaggerated reply that barry brook strict definition base load lowest amount power middle night rid load ian talked about generate energy time impact amount energy generate day hard fact time day solar wind generating electricity either problem period minimum delivery period cover stop electricity grid collapsing demonstrated worldwide problem theoretically youd overbuilding capacity huge number additional solar power plant wind power plant huge amount additional storage that mean quickly renewable grossly uneconomic technically economically would revisit point argument economic argument easily sort real world removing impediment power source allowing compete equal basis fundamental problem australia allowing nuclear energy compete sort basis paul comriethomson let explore that talking renewable job debate power need ian barry let pitch forward fundamental point disagreement you barry brook renaissance happening generation iii reactor ian lowe fast breeder reactor made work ian lowe let start you what worry generation iii fast breeder reactor what worry ian lowe paul doctorate physic research funded atomic energy authority building prototype fast breeder reactor dounreay north coast scotland atomic energy authority spent year working prototype fast breeder reactor gave usa essentially liquid metal fast breeder reactor technical problem intimidating barry agree think principle design breeder reactor avoid technical issue technical issue lot rabidly pronuclear people happy support building nuclear power station quietly terrified prospect fast breeder reactor inherent complexity breeder reactor occupying discussion obama administration agonising approve research breeder reactor concern weapon proliferation availability plutonium particular problem technically year research dont proven design breeder reactor breeder reactor made work and make uranium resource adequate long distance future assuming breeder reactor work putting circulation week plutonium entire global weapon stockpile moment dramatically increasing amount plutonium circulation beggar belief increase amount plutonium circulation dramatically misused paul comriethomson address safety minute but barry give reply generation iii reactorsian lowe say look dream theyre happening barry brook mark twain place rumour death breeder reactor greatly exaggerated fact killed due political decision technical one exemplar programme liquid metal fast breeder reactor called integral fast reactor astounding success developed argonne national laboratory point resulted blueprint developed general electric hitachi called sprism step required commercialise that technical problem solved problem existed technology solved development programme time build thing political decision made clinton administration kill technology bitter disappointment research aspect nuclear industry led continued building coal fired power station today nation continue deploy fast reactor continue develop technology hard fact technology developed awaiting commercialisation successfully simply waiting renewable energy advocate waiting government gut ahead this paul comriethomson ian lowe alluded obama administration barack obama gordon brown cameron pronuclear obama administration weighing matter moment weapon proliferation remain problem nuclear power potential weapon there barry brook say surprisingly some nuclear power safest energy option like barry defend that ian say nuclear power safest energy option that barry brook back history energy form energy weve developed caused people killed caused accident apple apple comparison fair basis number people killed megawatt hour measure energy generated basis safest energy source nuclear power solar power people killed falling repairing wind turbine instance killed killed nuclear power industry broader safety important people appreciate youre concerned climate change youre concerned peaking fossil fuel supply developed today run energy safety well dont deal adequate comprehensive doesnt matter swept away deploying solution doesnt fix problem run risk fixing problem dangerous strategy put credence ian importance climate change caused anthropogenic carbon emission paul comriethomson ian addressed safety working nuclear material stuff wrong hand nuclear power station have possibility nuclear weapon rogue hand address that barry brook difficult establish link commercial nuclear power development nuclear weapon today state suspect nuclear weapon commercial nuclear power plus nation and coming year embracing nuclear power time abandon nuclear power circumstance goal people oppose nuclear power basis weapon proliferation expect country china india forgo nuclear power world rid nuclear technology dont practical ambition all time frame talking replace fossil fuel australia weapon proliferation ahead nuclear power industry responsibility fissile material lead showing safely nuclear power involved weapon nonproliferation treaty active way involved management fissile material clear development commercial nuclear power decision desperate nation state decide build nuclear weapon paul comriethomson ian lowe followup question you barry brook talked australia taking lead let remind large proportion world uranium ground large proportion world thorium nuclear wasteyou barry ideas barry technology solve waste problem credible strategy prove waste problem ian lowe problem nuclear waste ian lowe problem current nuclear power station produce waste mix highly radioactive material isolated biosphere hundred thousand year technical challenge social challenge talking period longer human civilisation endured order magnitude confident waste isnt threat future generation confident secured way technically sound proof social occur geological time current arrangement dont meet goal case radioactive waste sitting pond water nuclear power station authority working developing final solution dare phrase problem radioactive waste paul comriethomson aside training physic happened synrock ian lowe point make adage nature correct material scientist horrified nuclear authority northern hemisphere talking putting radioactive waste glass glass isnt solid stable geological time supercool liquid stable geological time absence heat radioactivity pure fantasy safely immobilise radioactive waste block glass geological time late

admit theyre wrong embrace what technology paul comriethomson clear here youre suggesting synrock nuclear waste ian lowe principle immobilise radioactive isotope synrock synrock sealed responsible place immobilise nuclear waste weve produced now doesnt make lot sense expand amount nuclear waste factor factor building nuclear power station weve big problem waste now paul comriethomson barry brook ian lowe talking hundred thousand yearsi youre mention year and again youre talking technology solving waste problem talk barry brook yes technology reduce lifetime waste let consequence current waste talking miniscule amount material here nuclear power million time concentrated chemical energy coal concentrated form energy compared solar wind energy logically work amount waste million time less waste generated nuclear power plant world youre covering football field metre high talking tiny amount waste coal fired power station megawatt produce close million tonne carbon dioxide year bunch fly ash release smokestack uranium thorium nuclear power plant consume year talking huge difference amount waste waste remaining dilute radioactive uranium ore encapsulate glass synrock sensibly reprocess waste safe building nuclear bomb generating huge amount energy weve mined uranium fast reactor supply world electricity hundred year consume spent fuel produced date tap depleted uranium stockpile sitting waiting energy technically consume waste dont manage year argue reason building repository today handle waste year lot nuclear power understand silly dream noone pursue point technical solution available what holding back now economic uranium cheap mine cheap run generation reactor burn sixtenth energy uranium technically essentially sitting problem talk people recently assessed recommendation sit problem year hurry solving argue hurry biggest public perception nuclear power misguided belief dont nuclear fuel proper definition people nuclear waste paul comriethomson ian barry talking people sitting hand term thinking nuclear waste australian prime minister policy initiate term energy ian lowe announcing tonight budget mix measure produce clean energy future australia absence emission trading scheme starting modest carbon tax tonne give notice increase tonne year emission trading scheme place increase renewable energy target pick report howard government report national framework energy efficiency showed reduce emission measure pay year adopt commitment clean energy future australia billion subsidise mining industry applying diesel fuel rebate billion billion dollar spend year subsidising coal fired smelting aluminium fighting fund build renewable energy australia money develop export coal infrastructure contribute globally problem home money develop public transport australia integrated package measure assume wayne swan announced paul comriethomson barry brook hypothetical minister agenda support course carbon tax make nuclear economically attractive barry brook illegal australia now compete levelised basis fundamental argument underpinning carbon price drive innovation deployment clean energy technology clean energy technology turn uneconomic inevitable increase cost energy potentially slow deployment rate noone sure start decent carbon price technology driven fastest turn cheapest taking nuclear power table developed nation imagine zealand argue theyre developed nation not nuclear table joking zealand theyve renewable energy resource depend largely hydro theyve sheep depend methane well australia hasnt sort option australia abundance uranium country world deploying nuclear power now choosing purely economic reason china now audience realise china building moment nuclear power station sure theyre building wind turbine theyre building hydro dam well add amount electricity generated decade nuclear power station vastly outweigh amount generated wind turbine built china china making economic decision here paul comriethomson ian lot talk china theyre spreading bet australia that invest solar invest nuclear call bob day ian lowe well bob way invest solar wind geothermal put significant research resource wave energy efficiency measure dramatically reduce demand energy remember amory lovin famously said people dont energy hot shower cold beer energy mean end energy dark process information fly interstate respectable study bookfactor four suggest reduce factor amount energy needed accomplish task dont analysis concluded factor cost effective measure exist today significance make task easier reduce demand energy people arent reduce demand turning light freezing dark give technology beer cold half energy example typical swedish refrigerator size half electricity typical australian refrigerator fact significant number refrigerator sale street legally sold western europe dont meet minimum efficiency standard dissipating people money heating planet unnecessarily spread bet fact youre renewable youd accept gore idea isnt silver bullet silver buckshot lot add solving problem barry point shouldnt short term least achieving selfsufficiency renewable study mark diesendorf conclude make sense power gas gas turbine standby measure time extended period unavailability renewable dramatically reduce cost paul comriethomson barry brook followup you weve discussed term technology energy youve made point move electric car lot energy nuclear important there barry brook energy form car driven oil convenient carrier energy source energy car future powered battery form synthetic fuel create electricity create longer mine oil degree weve had decarbonise economy oil all total amount electricity demand inevitably rise result needing replace transport fuel broadly australia world electricity demand vast majority people planet electricity huge amount electricity aspire bit more place china instance capita tenth electricity use reduce electricity half require extraordinarily heroic effort china increase time level talking worldwide supplying lot electricity delivered concentrated form energy cheap ultimately replace fossil fuel quickly possible fastest route electricity generated clean energy source cheaper coal that argument imposing international carbon price difficulty multilateral agreement important people choose anyway argue point nuclear power already reason place china india grand deployment plan nuclear power pursuing vigorously environmental damage caused burning coal limited supply fact china world largest coal producer net importer coal increase theyre way reach clean energy independence and rightly pointed out theyre range energy source that philosophically difficult understand concerned climate change ian lowe rule viable energy source nuclear power basis minor argument miniscule amount waste deal technically anyway crazy cognitive dissonance paul comriethomson weve passionate environmentalist here passionate green diametrically opposed view nuclear power question audienceif pop microphone questioni stress question speech gentlemen answer question question audience member environmentalist applaud that feel stand mining uranium developing nuclear power totally hypocritical comment that ian lowe wed furious agreement hypocritical mine uranium develop nuclear power barry mine uranium develop nuclear power agree hypocrisy stilt extreme south australian government waxed indignant possibility lowlevel radioactive waste dump state store slightly radioactive glove hospital minor item arent contaminated radioactive dial watch theyre delighted championing digging biggest hole face earth export uranium put together logic position barry position mine logically consistent youre favour nuclear power favour mining uranium youre opposed nuclear power concerned mining uranium creating place problem wouldnt happy here problem radioactive waste potential fissile material misused audience member question million people world scale fairly insignificant put mildly billion chinese billion indian theyre uranium resource thorium them barry brook chance australia pull back uranium mining valuable resource there indeed ironically australias biggest contributor worldwide releasing greenhouse gas emission add amount emission effectively mitigated australias uranium export date already add carbon emission put together important pull rug contributingwere increasing burning fossil fuel coalfired power dont credible realistic scenario forgo uranium mining polymetallic mine olympic dam mine copper anyway leave uranium ground crazy stuff dont happen ian agreement path mining boom boost economy include uranium energy ensure responsible global citizen make energy manage ourselve ian lowe argument isnt economic one understanding economic roxby down reduce profitability regarded copper gold mine didnt extract uranium term earn exporting uranium exporting cheese radioactive waste unsavoury gorgonzola nonproliferation treaty hole swiss cheese expanded cheese export paul comriethomson well extended metaphor award night ian question audience member question barry brook waste issue dont youre aware australia national radioactive waste repository planned northern territory politically vulnerable moment contested indigenous people live there dont waste labour government martin ferguson push waste indigenous community proposing waste created nuclear power dump indigenous community world barry brook making decision waste waste repository youre talking make medical waste forgo radiotherapeutic responsibility sort waste australia doesnt commercial nuclear power station put somewhere forcing indigenous land people dont want bad decision sweden provide financial incentive community number community bidding vigorously nuclear waste repository end forsmark community sweden nuclear power plant won contract youd similar situation australia people hungry manage sort issue audience member yes hungry housing medical schooling question you dodged well weaponshow protect nuclear war glass container synrock barry brook conflating nuclear power nuclear weapon completely wrong imagine youre eliminate nuclear weapon eliminate commercial nuclear power explain youre eliminate commercial nuclear power worldwide australia shouldnt commercial nuclear power nuclear weapon proliferation mount argument make difference whatsoever nuclear weapon worldwide ian lowe happy make argument iran neighbour nervous country plentiful resource oil gas renewable resource solar difficult expensive route building nuclear power station theyre understandably nervous real motivation build nuclear weapon neighbour nervous world bit nervous imagine lived indonesia malaysia australia appear gas desperate export renewable resource power australia solar wind time over view embracing nuclear power wouldnt worried motivation bomb inclined paranoia plenty statement nuclear technocrat late sir philip baxter late sir ernest titterton championed idea nuclear energy nuclear weapon fight asian hoard incredibly australia developed nuclear energy spark paranoia development nuclear weapon country north give nuclear arm race real tweak region barry brook fact hasnt happened worldwide country embracing nuclear energy time mount strong argument people indonesia country surrounding australias move nuclear power think well theyve woken form cheap energy last audience member couple question ian lowe mentioned mark diesendorf work mark diesendorf natural gas backup renewable isnt basically dont nuclear power burn fossil fuel natural gas instead ian lowe true natural gas backup youve reduced amount carbon dioxide youre putting air current goal world reduce emission developed country australia reduce reasonable transitional period make limited natural gas aim ease economic impact transitionbecause embrace nuclear energy renewable energy what clear electricity significantly expensive artificially low price paying cost carbon dioxide impact imposing future generation accept easing transition mean making limited natural gas shortterm shortterm year audience member mentioned advanced liquid metal reactor ifr good idea putting circulation huge amount plutonium plutonium plutonium nucleide plutonium heard discussed people barry brook initial start ifr light water reactor fuel strip transuranic plutonium reactor grade plutonium americium neptunium like material perfectly useable startup ifr weaponise material comment please ian lowe true study oxford research scale nuclear made significant contribution global target reducing carbon involve reprocessing enormous amount nuclear fuel calculation reprocessing nuclear fuel scale breeder
