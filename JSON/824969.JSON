Makes sense.  It's a stop-gap until electric becomes more feasible with greater range and a modest solar charging panel built in (albeit minute contributor, it could help a little...that or stored battery energy stations solar/electric to plug into when you get to work). Hybrids won't leave you stranded.  You still have the gas option that constantly recharges.....they just don't get enough MPG to send the masses running to buy one.
