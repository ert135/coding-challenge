mountain institute put fairly detailed study combining solar storage suggest levelized cost energy wont lower current price call year guy sound confident make sense sooner wanted that elon musk yes defiantly bear mind big world there place cost energy higher place hawaii energy cost shift fuel power plant expensive economic solar battery make sense place hawaii lot island nation anyplace expensive energy cost moderately expense energy cost make sense part europe part united state time make sense everywhere solar battery wind geothermal hydro long tail final coal plant finally stop operating final natural gas plant stop operating last long tail scurve typical technology adoption beginning scurve people tend predict what happen exponential growth phase approximately linear growth phase people overpredict what happen steep linear portion growth phase then back logarithmic complete sshape happened internet example cell phone happen here patrick archambault guess united state year reasonable timeframe economic start work elon musk massive cliff elon musk scale factory operate maximum capacity factory operating maximum capacity future see production meeting yesterday guy ramp production cell battery car faster addressing limiting factor can mentioned manufacturing machine build machine ill order magnitude improvement achieved wont version machine build machine order magnitude sort compared car manufacturing itll alien dreadnaught indiscernible land people dont realise improvement potential possible thick talking school physic out mega complicated factory volumetric density calculation percentage volume inside building stuff versus air stuff youll shocked tiny percentage low single digit velocity what exit velocity product fast moving exit what mass flow mdot factory low fastest car plant world car exit velocity basically grandma walker real slow metre really slow that fastest person run metre faster metre second car exit velocity metre second ridiculous volumetric efficiency car factory mid low single digit low shouldnt volumetric density very achievable design chip volumetric efficiency ridiculous design factory way patrick archambault efficiency put place tesla plant fremont stage future elon musk youll move direction model aspiring version alien dreadnaught level alien dreadnaught version youll directionally obvious cell production engineering team work closely panasonic make dramatic improvement cell manufacturing efficiency approaching efficiency plant world pretty good lot improvement cell bullet machine gun exit rate cell faster bullet machine gun patrick archambault well forward time around elon musk yes gigafactory eye opener operator you question colin langan ubs line open colin langan taking question lot analyst cover solarcity highlighting major liquidity concern company sounded pretty confident turn cash flow positive differently concerned cash burn increase deal elon musk well deal cash burn reduce reduced cost sale general operational efficiency lot duplicated duplicated expect cost decrease increase positive cash flow solarcity acquisition yes month effect pretty short order let month acquisition complete expect efficiency significant colin langan actually question term time horizon term delivering goal promise acquisition synergy achieved month post closing quick elon musk point deal done yes meaningful noticeable full quarter acquisition completed highly confident case operator you question patrick jobin credit suisse line open patrick jobin taking question here guess
