But this short flight was the first by an aircraft powered fully by solid hydrogen. The experimental drone runs on pellets that emit only water vapour when they burn. The fuel cell is also three times as light as a comparable lithium batte","m_szDocBody":"flight hydrogenpowered drone water vapour exhaust drone powered hydrogen pellet cleaner lighter conventional lithium battery perfect longdistance flight ready long haul sam lasted minute guy woolly hat highvis jacket looked drone enthusiast short flight aircraft powered fully solid hydrogen experimental drone run pellet emit water vapour burn fuel cell time light comparable lithium battery day technology make commercial aircraft lighter cleaner idea simple stick solid state hydrogen fuel drone fly tricky phil anderson scottish marine science argyll flight place hydrogenfuelled car eclipsed electric vehicle idea aircraft either previous effort cryoplane project airbus large tank liquid hydrogen superlow temperature tank big practical storing hydrogen pressurised gas efficient system designed firm cella solid pellet packed cartridge centimetrelong pellet made chemical compound produce steady stream hydrogen gently heated gas converted electricity fuel cell run drone rotor inclusion polymer stop compound melting help release hydrogen lower temperature anderson think future version drone perfect environmental climate monitoring team carry arctic north atlantic lighter batterypowered drone fly longer test flight hour fuel board anderson unlike battery put fuel far idea simple stick solid hydrogen fuel drone fly tricky plus cleaner main produce water vapour anderson lot science trace gase contamination drone propeller moving part susceptible effect called carburettor icing prevent petrol drone operating extreme cold say hope hydrogen drone carrying research science couple year tantalisingly technology drone city car eventually provide hydrogen power commercial aircraft anderson cella working french aviation firm safran produce pelletpowered fuel cell provide auxiliary power plane inflight entertainment galley lighting claim bigger commercial space drone missy cumming human autonomy lab duke university north carolina appeared print headline flying hydrogen topic ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076777-first-flight-of-hydrogen-powered-drone-with-water-vapour-exhaust/","m_Places":["Uk","North Atlantic","North Carolina"],"m_People":["Phil Anderson","Missy Cummings"],"m_Companies":["First Flight","Airbus","Humans","Duke University"],"m_BiGrams":["water vapour","fuel cell","drone fly"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":268}
