However, most of the writings focus on the supply side of the issue and emphasize the role of technology primarily on alternative fuel production. A US Army research paper by Colonel Fields is rather different. That is why this post is about his paper. Col. Fields argues that â€œA country equal or near equal in economic and military power but considerably less","m_szDocBody":"importance alternative energy military importance alternative energy military
