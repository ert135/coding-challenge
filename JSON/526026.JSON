a panel session titled, “The Remarkable Transformation of the Energy Sector: Does it Also Transform Our World.” The motivating question was: “Is the dramatic decline in oil prices a complete gift to the West because of the enormous funds being saved, or is it an unintended Trojan horse because development of renewable energy as well ","m_szDocBody":"posted keyword electricity energy security

source decline west posing longer challenge member panel private industry vastly expertise and relevant insight fossilfuel market here say sweet spot professional competence comment correction general answer question start and started premise dramatic decline crude oil price place august march due hand decreased demand function slow economic growth asia europe elsewhere endogenous pricedriven technological change leading greater fuel efficiency policydriven technological change leading greater fuel efficiency stringent corporate average fuel economy cafe standard united state hand due increased supply partly function growth unconventional tight oil production product combination technology horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing before proceeding note year crude oil price increased low level consequence examine virtually significant price change economic perspective inevitably good new bad new fall crude oil price bad new all assume low crude oil price problematic economic political stability country including saudi arabia russia venezuela nigeria second frequently asserted low oil price bad new development alternative form energy including renewable source course united state isnt effect electricity generation renewable wind solar electricity sector renewable supply compete coal natural gas fuel oil but country fuel oil electricity generation disincentive renewable dispatch development third indeed major impact motor fuel sector market biofuel mainly ethanol negatively affected low conventional gasoline price however impact muted public policy directly indirectly subsidise fact require biofuel fourth low gasoline price resulted decreased demand consumer motor vehicle fuel efficiency suv pickup truck sale rebounded previous low effect muted degree public policy including cafe standard finally low gasoline price shortterm effect form driving fuel existing fleet motor vehicle bad new term emission and congestion difference sector turning good new low crude oil price and surely good new worthwhile noting individual businesse low price good bad depend largely economic sector operate example commercial airline finally making profit due low price jet fuel their important variable operating cost manufacturer commercial aircraft lower demand plane low jet fuel price longterm norm primary factor driving larger airline replace aircraft fleet lower operating cost due greater fuel efficiency model good new finally upside significant crude oil market low oil price unambiguously good aggregate global welfare include consumer united state europe japan south korea and temporarily opec lost ability set price floor turning environmental realm good new possibility good new opportunity new energy climate change policy emerged low oil price first time reduce yet phase costly inefficient fuel subsidy exist part world developing country second gasoline price low natural gas supply holding electricity price united state time introduce progressive climate policy form carbonpricing carbon taxe carbon capandtrade unfortunately hold breath waiting happen first time reduce yet phase costly inefficient fuel subsidy exist part world developing country phase out subsidy calculated subtracting price oil sold domestic consumer oil exporting country international market price oil domestic retail oil price country close local low production cost oil order citizen benefit directly low cost indigenous oil productionobviously international market price oil rise fall production cost oil change quickly socalled subsidy rise fall tandem rise fall international oil price government supposedly increasing reducing oil subsidy artefact nonsensical misleading oil subsidy calculated oil exporting country tie domestic oil price international oil price largely eliminate socalled oil subsidy overnight expose citizen oil exporting country turbulence international oil market understandable oil exporting country government attracted prospect theory beneficial tax oil product tie price international oil price opposed domestic cost production order stimulate efficient consumption case failure tax oil product andor tie domestic price international price equal subsidising them confusion taxe subsidy risen fever pitch day appearance recent chronically misinterpreted imf report subject hopefully analyst communicator energy matter flurry propaganda misinformation popular notion fossil fuel financial loser compared renewable energy government stop subsidising fossil fuel ridiculous notion history energy discussion energy discussion replete ridiculous notion ubiquitous relentless deliberate propaganda misinformation fossil fuel significant external cost term pollution damage form subsidy calling domestic sale oil product cost production oil exporting country subsidy order arrive hundred billion dollar annual oil subsidy false misleading post comment roger arnold say true rising production north america combination lower consumption due efficiency gain sluggish world economy smaller expected production losse turmoil iraq libya lead surplus production capacity beginning summer initiate drop price however small part storey short term elasticity demand oil minor cutback opec producer price wanted happen saudi arabia made clear intention cutting production care price fell barrel price did saudi position explained determination maintain market share face rising north american production importance market share ingrained western business culture pundit accepted explanation face valueof saudis maintain market share andof cut price really inmy book crude oil textbook afungible commodity long term contract common brand loyalty advertise customer oil sell offering small discount current market price context market share meaningless production capacity producer compounding disconnect fact oil producer dont produce oil extract supply finite fieldswill depleted normal thing loss market share rival represent revenue deferred revenue lost sovereign producer large saudi arabia refusing cut production face falling market price ordinarily make sense loss revenue production cutback loss revenue plunging price oil pumped sale couple situation continued fullout production face falling oil price make sense sovereign producer specific intent slash market price order strangle competition producer expect recoup short term revenue loss stronger long term position situation producer reason reserve hold losing substantial future situation neednt mutually exclusive threat future reserve budding competition low market price aimed strangle situation obvious target saudi move north american producer expensive nonconventional oil gas tight shale operation tar sand operation canada equal greater long term threat falling demand disregarding climate change increasingly difficult disregard consideration adoption fuelefficient vehicle improving economic biofuel synthetic rise electric vehicle technological trend threaten cut future demand crude oil production capacity drive oil price now saudis wind sail alternative strategy worked can low oil price scared investment fracking frozen expansion tar sand operation long term threat oil demand technological development strongly affected oil price temporarily cheap oil slowed rate sale electric vehicle dampened shift smaller fuelefficient car however stop advance battery technology making evs steadily attractive wont stop research efficient production biofuel prevent improvement cost efficiency hydrogen production hydrogenbased fuel fact saudis sacrifice revenue order set speed bump road alternative suggest anyway handwriting wall unload market begin dry certainty interpretation correct extent good new climate good new clean energy sector bad new oil industry see sean say market pressure market pressure renewable helped ethanol cheaper gasoline distributer started mixing margin state renewable effort reduced cost closest competition oil based ethanol price equivalent barrel roughly year create cap market charge mass exodus electric car biofuel pretty lock cap second increase production expensive middle east production tar sand profitable last effort renewable oil producer interest price low slow growth alternative oil also sort writing wall dropping cap alternative reduced potential profit
