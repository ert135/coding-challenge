Professionally, this was a satisfying year for me as I was able to transition from being a technology/telecom reporter to being a full-time energy reporter, with alternative energy technologies now officially a major part of my day-to-day coverage. I covered the tech beat for nine years, and while there are some incredibly interesting advances going on with wireless and on the Web, I found myself getting pulled more and more toward clean technology coverage.
