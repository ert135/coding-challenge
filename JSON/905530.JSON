This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. When most of us think about smartphones, hybrid cars, and other new technologies, we are in awe of the vision and sophisticated skills it took to create them. But we often fail to realize that they all depend on rare metals few of us have even heard of. We talked with David Abraham , director of the Technology, Rare and Electronic Materials Center, about what this increasing dependency means for our future.
