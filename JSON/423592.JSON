Stepping grooves are formed in the top surface of the substrate; airbags are installed around the stepping grooves; the airbags are embedded in the substrate; an air pump is installed in the substrate and is connected with the airbags through a bellows; a heating rod is installed between the bellows and the airbags. The electric vehicle baseplate has the beneficial effects that legs are wrapped by the airbags, so that the efficiency of wind prevention is improved; hot air is circulated in the airbags","m_szDocBody":"electric vehicle baseplate comprise substrate stepping groove formed top surface substrate airbag installed stepping groove airbag embedded substrate air pump installed
