Thursday, August 9, 2012       Follow @OilVoice Follow @OilVoice   Natural gas is making a big comeback. I don’t mean the price yet, but the use of it as a vital fuel in the economy. Natural gas is right now the only fuel we have that can be used as a substitute for oil in transportation energy. Hydrogen is but a dream and electric cars are failing because they lack the features people are used to in gas engines. Those options are still on the table, but they are future options and not in the here and now. Natural gas will be the complementary transp","m_szDocBody":"answer oil dilemma natural gas thursday follow follow natural gas making big comeback dont price yet vital fuel economy natural gas fuel
