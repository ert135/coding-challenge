The majority of the worlds electricity comes from coal, which is starting to be phased out in the wealthier countries; renewable energies will not be able to fill the gap. Nuclear energy is the only solution to the future global electricity demand, uranium miners offer the best way to capitalize off the growth,","m_szDocBody":"nuclear power renewable energy coal
