The scooter carries an onboard recharging system to replenish the battery supply. Accordingly, the onboard recharging system is not called upon to provide the main power source for acceleration and other operating conditions. A recharging system is implemented either as a fuel cell which trickle charges the battery, or an internal combustion engine which recharges the battery through a mechanical charging unit such as
