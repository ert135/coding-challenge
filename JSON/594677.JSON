There is a need for high-energy-density, rechargeable batteries, as electric vehicles, portable electronics, and sustainable energy harvesting are on the rise. Conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are mature but limited in energy density, and don't satisfy the increasing demand for superior energy storage. Lithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries, with three to five times higher energy density (~2600 Wh kg-1 in theory) than Li-ion batteri","m_szDocBody":"sulfiphilic electrocatalyst dredge polysulfide flooding
