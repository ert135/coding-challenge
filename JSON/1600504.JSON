opportunity there sort hinted end keynote interested permeating technology end note grid itself ten thousand hundred thousand component mentioned lot areas successful differentiation opportunity kind intersection looked sort discrete opportunity highlight space monitoring machine condition monitoring application highlighted real prominently keynote tomorrow lot that stage senior folk duke energy largest regulated utility company large deployment machine condition monitoring system based compactrio goal interesting application fit between measurement application test measurement application deployed industrially rugged system putting compactrios machine attribute industrial ruggedness real time control ultimately wanted control machine fundamentally measurement data acquisition application show picture tomorrow complicated walk doing generation equipment eastern thousand machine monitor purpose preventative maintenance prevent predict failure goal outfit machine sensor measurement device put measurement device machine machine thousand measurement system goal basically complex analytic big data start aggregate information predict performance machine predict failure predict turbine blade break predict bearing out working partner expertise specific area focus labview kind preventative maintenance theyre ultimately intelligent node network compactrio put intelligence back compactrio control machine well statement compete with interesting storey type monitoring today kind speed preventative maintenance portable system technician have those moving put device machine new havent before basically prevent failure save lot money cost lot money transformer blow turbine down whatever equipment justified based preventing failure right goal real good initial success keynote stage joining keynote stage epri electric power research institute collective research institute power generation talking solution sort endorsing approach talking nis approach duke application compelling application opportunity core space represent fairly generic opportunity power generation well machine condition monitoring complex analytic managing lot data software run back end data distributed network itself pretty generic case lot opportunity yes unidentified analyst put dollar kind system term dollar sensor sensor talk range compactrio eric starkloff sure give sense dont reveal customer sense device plant server here equipment sensor arent acquiring data sensor goal outfit system compactrio equate number device opportunity scale application compactrio system youre talking compactrio system ish dollar depending configured utility application space substantial opportunity hand weve heard anecdote duke cost failure equipment monitoring ten million
