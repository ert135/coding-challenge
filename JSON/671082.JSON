The device is a supercapacitor—a cousin to the battery. This one packs an interconnected network of graphene and carbon nanotubes so tightly that it stores energy comparable to some thin-film lithium batteries—an ","m_szDocBody":"interconnected graphenecarbon nanotube network store large amount energy published written azonanomay scientist large step making fiberlike energy storage device woven clothing power wearable medical monitor communication equipment small electronic device supercapacitora cousin battery pack interconnected network graphene carbon nanotube tightly store energy comparable thinfilm lithium batteriesan area battery traditionally held large advantage product developer engineer scientist nanyang technological university ntu singapore tsinghua university china case western reserve university united state storage capacity volume called volumetric energy density highest reported carbonbased microscale supercapacitor date microwatt hour cubic millimetre device maintain advantage charging releasing energy faster battery fiberstructured hybrid material offer huge accessible surface areas highly conductive researcher developed continuously produce flexible fibre enabling scale production variety use date made metre long fibre limit length envision fibre supercapacitor woven clothing power medical device people home communication device soldier field say fibre spacesaving power source serve energycarrying wire medical implant yuan chen professor chemical engineering ntu led study working dingshan kunli goh hong wang wei wenchao jiang ntu qiang zhang tsinghua liming dai case western reserve scientist report research nature nanotechnology dai professor macromolecular science engineering case western reserve coauthor paper explained supercapacitor power density low energy density mean charge quickly give boost power long conversely battery energy density low power density mean long time deliver large amount energy quickly microelectronic electric vehicle benefit energy storage device offer power energy density researcher working develop device offer both continue miniaturise electronic industry tiny energy storage device large volumetric energy density mass supercapacitor comparable energy storage energy density battery require large amount accessible surface area store energy lagged badly energy density volume approach improve energy density volume researcher designed hybrid fibre solution acidoxidized singlewall nanotube graphene oxide ethylenediamine promote synthesis dope graphene nitrogen pumped flexible narrow reinforced tube called capillary column heated oven hour related storey datemeta ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.azonano.com/news.aspx?newsID=30093","m_Places":["Nanyang","Singapore","China","United States","Dai"],"m_People":["Yuan Chen","Dingshan Yu","Kunli Goh","Wang, Li","Wei","Wenchao Jiang","Qiang Zhang"],"m_Companies":["Tsinghua University","Case Western Reserve University","Case Western Reserve"],"m_BiGrams":["energy density","energy storage","large amount","storage device","case western","western reserve"],"m_TriGrams":["energy storage device","case western reserve"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[8,4,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":302}
