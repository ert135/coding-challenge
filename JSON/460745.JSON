Keyser, Ahmad Pesaran, and Mark Mihalic Third Advanced Automotive Battery Conference, June 2003 ABSTRACT Compact Power Incorporated (CPI) and LG Chem have been developing high-power lithium- ion (Li-Ion) polymer batteries over the past few years. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has supported this development with thermal characterization and analysis of three generations of CPI prototype Li- Ion polymer cells.
