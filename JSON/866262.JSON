The drive shaft powers a generator, machine, pump, grind-stone or other load the mill is designed to operate. Fabric, metal, or plastic sails are fitted to the frame arms of the sail assembly such that they are releasable under upset conditions such as hurricane or tornado wind velocities or other catastrophic inclusion.
