EV manufacturer Tesla joins Panasonic to go into the battery business, then into energy storage. EVs are about to surpass consumer electronics for battery demand. Energy storage threatens to overwhelm EVs. At the centre of this storm is the lithium-ion battery, being produced in ever-greater abundance and calling for ever-greater supplies of lithium, graphite and cobalt.
