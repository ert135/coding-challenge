This one-atom thick layer of carbon has been found to have such remarkable properties that its discoverers were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2010. Graphene is incredibly light , and has excellent electrical conductivity. This has led to its use in prototype supercapacitors, but making these devices scalable has p","m_szDocBody":"graphene nanoball make supercapacitor super graphene nanoball make supercapacitor super ryan whitwam comment graphene hot scientific circle produced oneatom thick layer carbon found remarkable property discoverer awarded nobel prize graphene incredibly light excellent electrical conductivity led prototype supercapacitor making device scalable proven challenge team researcher ulsan national institute science technology south korea solved turning graphene tiny threedimensional orb point supercapacitor significant charge quickly hold charge long time releasing also quickly supercapacitor basically middle ground regular capacitor rechargeable battery speed power capacitor larger energy storage battery device interest reverse charge time wearing out existing supercapacitor low capacity energy density power density considerably higher lithiumion cell graphene ideal material application addition conductivity huge surface area relative mass thus increase power density recharge speed reducing weight see graphene supercapacitor time powerful made dvd burner processe fabricate graphene sheet varied chemical vapour deposition cvd common cvd job done terribly efficient process supercapacitor based graphene considerably economical viable ulsan national institute team led prof jihyun jang developed approach synthesise threedimensional graphene nanonetwork gns similar chemical vapour deposition process making sheet graphene carefully winding compact supercapacitor researcher essentially grow tiny sphere graphene retain superb electrical property graphene technique produce customizable graphene structure ease and lower cost current method team call spherical structure mesoporous graphene ball enhance graphene superconductor important way graphene nanonetwork object reinforce conductivity graphene increasing conductivity mesopore graphene ball form tiny ion transport channel improve superconductor durability superconductor created professor jang team showed incredible level resilience chargedischarge cycle capacitance measured original youre lucky rechargeable battery last hundred cycle unusable researcher managed produce gramme mesoporous graphene ball time sound like process prove scalable jang suspect finally make supercapacitor viable larger application cell phone supercapacitor charge minute recharging electric vehicle time filling tank gasolinepowered car ryan whitwam ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/160708-3d-graphene-nanoballs-could-make-supercapacitors-more-super","m_Places":["South Korea"],"m_People":["Ryan Whitwam","Jemaah Islamiah -hyun Jang","Professor Jang"],"m_Companies":["Ulsan National Institute Of Science And Technology","Ulsan National Institute"],"m_BiGrams":["make supercapacitor","graphene ball"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":291}
