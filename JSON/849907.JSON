The figure is now about 16% from eight reactors. A coalition government formed after the 1998 federal elections had the phasing out of nuclear energy as a feature of its policy. With a new government in 2009, the phase-out was cancelled, but then reintroduced in 2011, with eight reactors shut down immediately. The cost of attempting to replace nuclear power with renewables is estimated by the government to amount to some â‚¬1000 billion without","m_szDocBody":"nuclear power germany updated germany obtained
