View gallery (4 images) If Joseph Zawodny, a senior scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center, is correct, the future of energy may lie in a nuclear reactor small enough and safe enough to be installed where the home water heater once sat. Using weak nuclear forces that turn nickel and hydrogen into a new source of atomic energy, the process offers a light, portable means of producing tremendous amounts of energy for the amount of fuel used. It could conceivably power homes, ","m_szDocBody":"nasas basement nuclear reactor picture nasas research hold promise home nuclear reactor image nasa gallery image joseph zawodny senior scientist nasas langley research centre correct future energy lie nuclear reactor small safe installed home water heater sat weak nuclear force turn nickel hydrogen source atomic energy process offer light portable mean producing tremendous amount energy amount fuel used conceivably power home revolutionise transportation clean environment currently nuclear power mean approaches fission involve splitting atom uranium plutonium release energy employed military civilian nuclear plant fusion involve forcing hydrogen atom form helium releasing energy controversial decade research phase practical application then nickel lattice image nasa problem current nuclear technology fission produce nuclear waste poor public image fusion fission involve generating large amount dangerous ionising radiation processe require large complicated installation heavy shielding conventional nuclear reaction rely called strong nuclear force force hold atom together breaking heavy atom forcing light atom release energy run nation blow zawodny researcher working called lowenergy nuclear reaction lattice energy nuclear reaction lenr late cold fusion proponent light theory rigorous experimenting thought nuclear energy released chemical reaction theory ended discredited today changed theory approach researcher there lot people build understanding anything zawodny said worked edison light bulb long time simple system complex make barely work accidentally thousand work really well house trialanderror method nickel lattice absorbing hydrogen ion image nasa zawodny lenr thought cold fusion involve strong nuclear force instead weak nuclear force responsible decay subatomic particle lenr process involve setting condition turn weak force energy radioactive element uranium plutonium lenr lattice sponge nickel atom hold ionised hydrogen atom sponge hold water electron metal lattice made oscillate energy applied electron concentrated them energetic enough electron forced hydrogen proton form slow neutron immediately drawn nickel atom making unstable set reaction neutron nickel atom split proton electron antineutrino nickel copper release energy dangerous ionising radiation trick configure process release energy going turn frequency work call valley inaccessibility zawodny said between say thz thz good source make controlled frequency lenr long day buy home nuclear reactor fact proven phenomenon exist hundred experiment worldwide heat transmutation minimal radiation low energy input place yield watt work validate claim happening laboratory theory codeveloper lewis larsen lenr occur naturally lightning primordial cloud gas dust formed earth explain oxygen isotope planet sun different made work practical application revolutionary fission achieved fusion promised theoretically process yield million time energy chemical reaction dennis bushnell chief scientist nasa langley research centre percent nickel mined year meet world energy quarter cost coal past year lab blown studying lenr window melted showing work produce impressive amount energy zawodny logical application lenr home reactor produce heat electricity home charging family electric car area transportation light portable reactor powering supersonic aircraft flying car danger radiation power space plane capable reaching orbit stage external fuel tank area interest environment lenr reactor carbon run converting element nitrogen zawodny sequestering carbon dioxide control climate change eliminate toxic carbon compound turning waste fuel future lenr matter taking step back nuclear physic generation leapt straight strong force reaction goal back study weak force from perspective physic experiment zawodny said interested understanding phenomenon real about step develop rule engineering that engineer fun that bit irrefutable reproducible proof system work that throw asset buy put house ","m_szGeo1":"Australia","m_szSourceType":"source_general","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.gizmag.com/nasa-lenr-nuclear-reactor/26309/","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Joseph Zawodny","Lewis Larsen","Dennis Bushnell"],"m_Companies":["Nasa","Langley Research Center"],"m_BiGrams":["nuclear reactor","nuclear force","release energy","image nasa","nuclear reaction","zawodny said","nickel atom"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[4,4,4,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":536}
