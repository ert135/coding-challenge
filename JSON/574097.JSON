New analysis from the experts in solar PV, IHS, predicts a massive drop-off in solar installations in China during the third quarter of 2016, with an expected drop of 80%. This will in turn trigger a massive global slowdown, which itself will result in a global oversupply of solar PV parts, particularly solar modules.
