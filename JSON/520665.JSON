talking raising interest rate year commodity price fall explain piece happening forcing economic growth upward falling interest rate interest rate solow hard force rate further order encourage economic growth falling interest rate hugely beneficial economy interest rate stop dropping worse yet begin rise lose beneficial factor affecting economy economy tend grow quickly bringing commodity
