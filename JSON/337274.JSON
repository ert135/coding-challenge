Layer by layer additive construction. 200 times faster than conventional methods. 5 times lower cost for construction. - Inflatable electric cars. Flatship cars from a factory like Ikea furniture and could be as cheap as $2500 for an environmentally friendly car. - Reel to reel production of electronics can be hundreds to th","m_szDocBody":"nanotechnology home new modelling enabling manufacturing construction revolution abstract seed revolution are contour crafting scaling prototyping making building cement jet cement ink layer layer additive construction time faster conventional method time lower cost construction inflatable electric car flatship car factory ikea furniture cheap environmentally friendly car reel reel production electronic hundred thousand time faster current lithography factory making computer factory making electronic television video monitor seed wafer scale assembly nanoscale component nanotube material nanosteel withstand higher temperature retain strength wood based fibre make paper cardboard stronger cast iron cheap plentiful material strong application source ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.nanotech-now.com/news.cgi?story_id=29633","m_Places":[],"m_People":[],"m_Companies":["Revolution","Ikea"],"m_BiGrams":[],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":94}
