An active layer of silicon nanoparticles and polyaniline surrounds the electrode. An electrolyte layer surrounds the active layer. The electrolyte layer can be a layer of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). A super capacitor can be formed with two or more of the threads, such as in a twisted pair configuration. The dimensions of the super capacitor can approximate standard threads used in clothing, for example. Images(5) 1.
