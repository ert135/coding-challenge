Now a study co-authored by two MIT researchers has shown, in unprecedented geographic detail, another stark reality: Poor people live shorter lives, too.Â More precisely, the study shows that in the U.S., the richest 1 percent of men lives 14.6 years longer on average than the poorest 1 percent of men, while among women in those wealth percentiles, the difference is 10.1 years on average","m_szDocBody":"stepner abraham rich poor huge mortality gap poverty deprivation areas including housing employment education study coauthored mit researcher shown unprecedented geographic
