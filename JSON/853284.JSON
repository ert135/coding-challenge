Now, they seem to be about to have a breakthrough with nuclear power, announcing that they plan to have an advanced reactor online by the end of next year. The hopeful design is a high-temperature, gas cooled, pebble-bed reactor. The key advantage is its passive safety â€“ it is unable to melt down. This is due to the fact the uranium fuel is encased in pebble sized balls, preventing the ","m_szDocBody":"china set year advanced nuclear posted suzanna hinson chinese long responded rapidly growing
