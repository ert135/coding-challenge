The embodiment may be configured so that control of the VGS also controls the voltage Vin on the input. Vin may be adjusted without altering the device geometry or changing the drain current. This allows for better control and optimization of available headroom for the input voltage in low voltage designs and also results in higher ac","m_szDocBody":"active cascode circuit backgate control
