Here's an inside look. share At the end of February, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy — ARPA-E — held its seventh annual Energy Innovation Summit in Washington, D.C., bringing together more than 2,300 people to hear clean energy luminaries, including former Vice President Al Gore, offer their thoughts on the future of energy. But the real news took place before the summit, when more than $1.25 billion was granted to private companies, some of which are worki","m_szDocBody":"futuristic battery project power tomorrow
