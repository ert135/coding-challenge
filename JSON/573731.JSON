Said motor generator converts the chemical energy from the heat of reaction to electrical or mechanical energy. The spent alkali hydroxides formed from the reaction are stored for subsequent regeneration to the starting sodium potassium fuel. Hydrogen gas formed in the alkali metal-water reaction is delivered along with air to a second generator which converts the chemical energ","m_szDocBody":"fuel vehicle system based liquid alkali metal
