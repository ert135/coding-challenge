this investing lot intangible oddmillion year term startup cost programme they intangible investment huge amount yet sort breakout begin down short thinking half materially down adam walker similar level month ago right trend coming down big investment seen engine coming start move onward nigel stein big driver that sandy passed peak heading down sandy morris right sticking million intangible term cash flow size halve something nigel stein absolutely sandy morris hate labour north america remember running before cvjs allwheel drive kind startup wrong nigel stein complicated storey phil shed bit light manufacturing business time living problem day car industry doe bigger engineering problem picked designed couple year ago happened now consequence clear running catch customer down running catch put awful lot extra cost basically happened caught cost continue month bedded down actually product developed very successful product painful launch process hope repeat phil add that phil swash say programme complex get engineering specification management important job that customer vehicle dynamic demand vehicle extremely challenging term performance critically noise key issue drove awful lot late change length supply chain mean cost that implication that severe unlike day aerospace week blink eye cost tend build positive nigel said managed period absolutely world leading piece rear drive module technology quietest market helping customer involved sell vehicle anticipated lot growth that sandy morris right chance generic model nigel stein generic model underestimate manufacturing launch issue work hard overcome industry doe bit million move fast push thing bigger usual called shame driveline really good half were top moving forward sandy morris mean over nigel stein well sandy worry sandy morris powder metallurgy order shorter smaller size nigel stein powder metallurgy contract shorter lived smaller size nigel stein contract are mention picking component slightly smaller engine size actual size component and therefore unit selling price price size unit component down profitable demonstrated margin peter that peter oberparleiter engine cylinder
