They both need to be part of an overall energy and technology development plan, but a key point is technology and good planning can solve the issues that the world is concerned about. Some may say, hey if we can solve peak oil and climate change with those simple technologies and painless plans then we are done. No, we have to provide enough clean energy so","m_szDocBody":"reddit previously looked technology hand solving excess manmade possible global warming simple hand technology plan addressing peak oil part energy technology development plan key point technology good planning solve issue world concerned about say hey solve peak oil climate change simple technology painless plan done provide clean energy living china india africa etc rich require lot energy capita negawatt plan basically plan make poor energy person negawatt bad plan ignore people want long term switch clean electric power source nuclear fission nuclear fusion solar wind geothermal hydroelectric other john mccain proposed tax credit electric car inexpensive electric car cost purchased extra commuter vehicle wait people rid current car decade more model inflatable electric car price starting inexpensive vehicle make economic sense driver cost recovered fuel saving year year current expensive hybrid update addressing possibility inflatable electric car deliver hoax cheap electric car possibility listed here electric tata nano concept inflatable electric car sound impossible offer valid radical concept worthwhile research vehicle solution peak oil offsetting peak oil decade time transition build nuclear energy source peak oil problem oil production start decline price oil increasing rapidly current price increase peak lite demand exceeding supply supply increasing rapidly scale ten million hundred million electric car driving range charge mile hold passenger electric commuter car rapidly achieve adoption government support price regulation world fuel usage displaced million barrel oil day straight line year deployment fuel saving cumulatively increase million barrel oil day year oil production decline million barrel day offset decline production free algae biofuel production increase measure address increased demand indias tata motor rumoured produce compressed air car cost india range mile electricity compress air refuelling material vehicle supply issue replacing million car unlike lithium performance battery range compressed air car drop driven highway speed half distance analyst build infrastructure compressor station comply strict safety standard prevent compressed air car city based commuter option niche vehicle north america basically nonstarter rinek admitting limited niche market the potential any innercity shortcommute vehicle ultragreenie owner business week race make cheap speculist noted appear short bridge transition car hybrid car electric car light electric car less number battery expensive part electric car targeting low end market fewer battery move material note make car cheaper which increase unit sale easier ramp battery industry support electric vehicle battery amount battery make car one projection million electric car year million electric car million electric bike scooter made year bike scooter weight pound move person mph range mile light electric car including passenger move time weight loaded electric scooter pound time battery million electric car equal battery million power electric scooter lighter car lower power requirement make integrated solar panel prius solar panel power air conditioning toyota prius horsepower tata nano engine electric tata nano car solar panel provide hour driving time hour charging time ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/07/viable-electric-cars-for-less-than-5000.html","m_Places":["China","India","Africa","United States","North America"],"m_People":["John Mccain"],"m_Companies":["Reddit","Business Week"],"m_BiGrams":["electric car","peak oil","million electric","inflatable electric","tata nano","million barrel","compressed air","air car","solar panel"],"m_TriGrams":["inflatable electric car","compressed air car","million electric car"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[14,5,5,3,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":466}
