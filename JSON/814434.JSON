These energy sources are not destroyed when we use the energy harnessed. How good is that? Renewable energies are alternatives to traditional sources, hence the title ‘alternative’. They are different to  fossil fuels  or  nuclear power,  which must be consumed (coal or gas burnt in power stations, oil in transport, uranium in nuclear power) to release energy.  To utilise renewable sources requires developing technologies that harvest this energy. For instance, specific technologies like ","m_szDocBody":"return alternative energy renewable alternative energy renewable energy passion energy source destroyed energy harnessed good that renewable energy alternative traditional source alternative fossil fuel nuclear power consumed coal gas burnt power station oil transport uranium nuclear power release energy utilise renewable source require developing technology harvest energy instance specific technology below needed efficiently convert natural processe energy power society biological processe biomass including ethanol palm oil bio fuel bio diesel algae make bio diesel waste oil bio diesel algae home renewable energy considered pivotal wedge combat global warming stabilise climate reduction carbon dioxide emission investment renewable energy billion increased renewable energy option mentioned above heard flying energy generator solar thermal tower magnetic levitation wind generator solar stove oven bio mimicry learning range alternative science renewable technology solar power fact enable understand mechanism reduce global warming combat climate change transport peak oil crisis doubt oil stock reserve dwindling year future oil past extent forecast force cleaner alternative however alternative energy necessarily carbon emitter close generally sustainable renewable energy obvious choice reduce carbon dioxide atmospheric pollutant contributing global warming combat greenhouse gase global warming alternative energy viable choice traditional fossil fuel source ipcc report carbon emission fossil fuel transport sector rising faster sector transport mode responsible growth car travel road freight air transport tesla electric car amazing lynne mason wonderful dedicated electric car extensive range option reducing greenhouse gas emission hybrid electric vehicle hevs plugin hybrid electric vehicle phevs mass production technology pack car ride work electric scooter convert car electric option explored include alternative fuel hydrogen fuel cell algae bio diesel idea waterforgas planner beginning focus public nonmotorised transport fundamental transport urban planning electricity electricity lighting town city generated coal fired steam boiler began earnest coal led recent surge global energy demand strong growth path statistic world coal institute show coal global primary energy generate world electricity production coal grown year burning coal produce billion tonne carbon dioxide year released atmosphere power generation estimate put carbon dioxide emission power generation world total incredible billion tonne emission annually growth industrial energy demand nonoecd country notably china clean coal technology seeking address problem world enormous resource coal utilised future generation contributing global warming technology carbon capture storage geosequestration term renewable energy contributing electricity agenda whopropagatethe fallacy alternative energy contribute base load power insignificant true mix renewable energytechnology significant power generation possible happening vehicle grid concept mean storing energy releasing back electricity grid demand tantalising idea climate change global challenge country work develop instal alternative energy low emission technology accelerate energy efficiency improvement recently lord oxburgh chairman shell oil said talking war fought earth have hope developed nation earth putting resource this support playing part developing nation well modern day equivalent world war interested grid living alternative energy solar panel build homemade wind generator make bio diesel cheque ebook page ","m_szGeo1":"China","m_szSourceType":"source_general","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.global-greenhouse-warming.com/alternative-energy.html","m_Places":["Tesla","China"],"m_People":["Lynne Mason","Oxburgh"],"m_Companies":["Diesel","Path","Coal Institute","Oecd","Indeed","Shell"],"m_BiGrams":["alternative energy","renewable energy","bio diesel","global warming","carbon dioxide","fossil fuel","power generation"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[7,7,5,5,4,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":466}
