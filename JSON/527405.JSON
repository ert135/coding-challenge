Is this “just another cycle,” or is it something much worse? I think it is something much worse. Back in January, I wrote a post called  Oil and the Economy: Where are We Headed in 2015-16?  In it, I said that persistent very low prices could be a sign that we are reaching limits of a finite world.","m_szDocBody":"posted keyword energy security communication messaging utility environmental policy oil finance risk management energy energy economy fuel new deflation economic risk energy
