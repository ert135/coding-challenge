After a series of high-level visits to SolarReserve’s Crescent Dunes project in Nevada, Shenhua wants to take the dispatchability in SolarReserve’s Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) to the next level. The 110 MW Crescent Dunes tower CSP project supplies 1,100 MWh per day of solar to light up Las Vegas by night or to be dispatched on demand when needed i","m_szDocBody":"susan kraemer chinas largest
