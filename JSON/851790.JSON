The topic was the potential role of nuclear power in Australia. Below is the transcript of the interview, broadcast on 13 July, and a link to the original .MP3 audio of the broadcast. I’d be interested in any feedback you, as BNC readers, have — not only on the content of the interview (remember, this was done off the top of my head, so there may be a few minor misstatements), but

multiple system failing reactor proposed that law physic violated likely paul comriethomson likely mile island chernobyl reactor past barry brook chernobyl special type reactor built russian breed plutonium bomb graphite core meant problem reactor water flow stop run control american reactor that chernobyl lacked containment building problem started graphite fire radioactive material dispersed air disaster happen american reactor mile island lesson poor training staff failed system notifying staff happening made mistake opening valve shutting letting water shouldnt have mile island didnt hurt anyone fatality radioactivity note released environment worstcase scenario american reactor essentially problem reactor destroyed cost million dollar set back american nuclear programme decade effect public opinion gradually changed paul comriethomson happened day release moviethe china syndrome barry brook speculated inthe china syndrome reactor melt completely floor building earth steam explosion spread radioactivity everywhere didnt eventuate completely unrealistic scenario paul comriethomson yes convincing unrealisticconvincing term entertainment let explore cost build time standardised modular passive safety design factory built shipped site theyre game industry change game barry brook biggest problem american reactor programme stalled mile island notwithstanding cost escalating cost million build reactor cost billion early terribly wrong part legal suit extended reactor certification time period decade part antinuclear movement that part design different built anew feature out design needed special certificate built certificate run system ultimately set fail expensive system standardised design component built specification component built factory shipped needed constructed site module theyre smaller put rail car large truck unit put constitute plant start huge benefit term efficiency fact dont standardised certificate reactor economic benefit building multiple unit factory place happening china india now blamed worst carbon polluter ultimately ironically nation lead carbon economy low carbon economy based nuclear power paul comriethomson switkowski report nuclear power australia mentioned fast reactor potential barry brook fast reactor type reactor design reactor experimental breeder reactor built work glitches nuclear power production fast reactor reactor built commercial reactor japan france what light water reactor theyre basically design pressurised water reactor boiling water reactor water slow neutron nuclear reaction make fission uranium likelyit bit technical topic know basically make lot easier generate power uranium fast reactor technology water cool fuel transfer heat steam turbine liquid metal sodium used lead possibility hard imagine molten metal coolant reactor doe number advantage burn uranium burn uranium people heard depleted uranium uranium left youve enrich increase concentration uranium stuff bullet tank armour common energy that fast reactor potentially unlock time energy uranium that spent fuel generated world nuclear reactor date generate power that change year management problem year management problem paul comriethomson nuclear power world primary source sustainable carbon free energy big claim barry brook well source energy require carbon construct range technology dont emit carbon theyre generating power nuclear power those great advantage nuclear power relying diffuse variable power source renewable energy rely upon relying extremely concentrated power source kilogramme uranium energy million kilogramme coal coal concentrated form energy incredibly concentrated form energy harness full advantage didnt answer earlier question completely asked werent fast reactor now main reason simple matter economic fast reactor require special type reprocessing fuel pyroprocessing doesnt separate plutonium make bomb require bit extra money close fuel cycle era uranium cheap worth paying that uranium kilogramme highly economical date abundance uranium relative lack concern storing nuclear waste longterm stopped commercial development reactor paul comriethomson renewable answer role wind solar playing decade barry brook australia theyre play primary role reduce dependence carbon based energy simple fact year nuclear power here process involve public support discussion merit nuclear power potential problem dont educated debate australia now setting organisation certify reactor built year tenyear process case give attention wind solar achieve pessimism wind solar wont role future energy supply supply sufficient energy power industrial economy economy continue grow way problem backup storage energy sort grid connexion youre require remote areas harness energy areas diffuse variable nature technology require continental scale deployment provide power society weve small scale far power generated australia generated sort renewable talking wind solar termed technosolar opposed form renewable energy rely lot hydro power biomass burning burning wood form animal plant generated produce paul comriethomson people call economy moving carbon economy people talk desalination electric vehicle make point theyre energyhungry enterprise direction energy less barry brook yes right convenient energy carrier mine oil and lesser degree gas depleted energy carrier vehicular transport heating need create one create electricity ultimately electrified society notwithstanding contribution made biofuel aviation industry move electrical electrical society pretty easy math power demand triple decarbonise economy required multiple reason youre concerned climate change issue pollution involved coal particulate mercury heavy metal sulphate acid rain wed rid can sharp limitation supply oil ultimately gas point move fossil fuel dependence energy source nuclear power sufficiently sustainable source power provide growth energy demand million year paul comriethomson require radical rethink time green group rational promethean environmentalist call falling deaf ear moment barry brook not ive talked environmentalist greatly concerned climate change concerned energy supply future low carbon economy locked thinking renewable energy supporter renewable energy pushing this deluding imagining provide predominance energy supply talk environmentalist benefit nuclear power fact myth halftruth hang nuclear power industry beenwere true place superseded technological development theyre listen suggest people ardently antinuclear theyre immune argument theyll change mind vast majority people concerned environment and let face concerned planet fit live fit pass children listened sensibly argument argument nuclear power reasonable population board idea paul comriethomson canberra hear cry nuclear power plant backyard sort thrown upduring election campaign nuclear power plant placed bit work term public debate isnt there barry brook similar question metre wind turbine put backyard coalfired power station you answer case well nimby factor overcome nuclear power plant place put coastline cooling water ocean drinking supply youve large body water necessarily problem ultimately reactor built place lot people transmission line ideal place imagine place south australia large mining development huge demand desalinated water nuclear plant good supplying huge demand power mine expansion expand mining industry basis low carbon carbon energy supply water well winwin scenario prove people benefit nuclear power australia people europe france belgium living cheek jowl nuclear power plant decade extremely happy them take bit time people demonstrate people advantage reactor safe live door nuclear reactor number radiological study hypothetical person called fencepost man whos supposed house fencepost boundary nuclear power site approximately millirem radiation general public sound lot fact general public millirem radiation year natural source essentially difference living door nuclear power plant living place world indeed live top granite intrusion youd that people tend bit irrational radiation bit education campaign too paul comriethomson barry brook summing position youre painting picture nuclear power plant coastal region desalination plant mining region sound agreeable main public problem political problem accepted barry brook problem people concerned cost heavy cost involved setting sort industry place america lot speculation nuclear plant cost lot cost year china building lot reactor theyre constructing plan gigawatt nuclear reactor decade that talking big number here economic favourable china result buildout nuclear power argument replacing current coalfired power station retired retiring early nuclear power plant renewable energy relevant year true cost building substantial amount renewable energy power australia weve year essentially build power supply expanded renewable energy target lot cost reframe argument substantially people talking nuclear power warning havent started process now havent started public discussion ideas certification reactor here suitable site
