As the University of Leeds puts it, “deliberate, large-scale intervention in the Earth’s climate system” sounds wonderful — especially if it bypasses the need to do any actual change down here on Earth. However, the University of Leeds’ description is immediately followed by a clarification: “The delibe","m_szDocBody":"climate change geoengineering quick fix joshua hill world renewable energy solution climate change problem bogged politic economic geoengineering perfect solution university leed put deliberate largescale intervention earth climate system sound wonderful bypasse actual change earth however university leed description immediately clarification deliberate largescale intervention earth climate system quick fix global warming write jointpress release announcing uks publicly funded study geoengineering project conducted uks premier university studied geoengineering recently announced result event held royal london project were integrated assessment geoengineering proposal iagp led university leed stratospheric particle injection climate engineering spice led university bristol climate geoengineering governance cgg led university oxford uninitiated geoengineering description imagine salting chemical sort cloud reflect light back space ground fertilising ocean nutrient grow plankton turn soak carbon dioxide some beginning earth idea sensible theyre farfetched absurd sound surface absurd not geoengineering project long sat scientific consciousness option alongside inevitable drawnout renewable energy battle utterly insane result project essentially summedup quick fix professor pier forster add devil detail geoengineering expensive challenging previous estimate suggest benefit limited professor pier forster professor physical climate change university leed principal investigator iagp project example simulating spraying sea salt particle cloud brighten them found cloud susceptible particle tend coagulate fall reaching cloud base downfall absurd sciencefiction storey geoengineering doesnt lot air time atcleantechnica weve taggedthe storey total time past year proof needed planetsaveour sister site taggedit time year january vice president gore found idea ofgeoengineering appealing sandy dechert wrote time putting mildly gore himself idea put form pollution atmosphere cancel effect global warming pollution utterly insane research required royal published report influenced research worldwide identified major gap understanding initiated publicly funded study igap spice funded oxford cgg study igap university leedsintegrated assessment geoengineering proposal study uks interdisciplinary research study bringing expert field diverse climate modelling philosophy engineering cleverly designed simulation create necessity realworld testing favourite part research involved creating virtual reality rescue arctic sea ice dumping sulphur dioxide atmosphere stratotanker aircraft flying svalbard norway professor forster issue monitoring predicting effect action led huge indecision highlighted challenging deploy technique real world spice researcher university bristol working thestratospheric particle injection climate engineering study tack similar conclusion spice researcher volcanoe model creating simulation mimic effect geoengineering proposal matthew watson reader natural hazard university bristol principal investigator spice project said whilst clear temperature reduced deployment potential misstep considerable identifying risk hope contribute evidence base geoengineering determine deployment face threat climate change capacity good harm cgg led university oxford theclimate geoengineering governance study world project focus governanceand regulatory challenge research deployment geoengineering proposal finding showed current cost estimate unrealistic geoengineering focus mitigation adaptation climate change reversing climate change hear geoengineering large grain salt professor steve rayner jame martin professor science civilization university oxford principal investigator cgg project technology ideas practise true cost benefit geoengineering magic bullet pandoras box date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter havent reader survey yet now ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/11/28/climate-change-geoengineering-quick-fix/","m_Places":["Uk","London","United States","Oxford","Svalbard","Norway","Take"],"m_People":["Joshua S Hill","Piers Forster","Professor Piers Forster","Al Gore","Sandy Dechert","Gaps","Professor Forster","Matthew Watson","Professor Steve Rayner"],"m_Companies":["University Of Leeds","Royal Society","Particle","University Of Bristol","Cgg","University Of Oxford","Tagged","Pandora"],"m_BiGrams":["climate change","university leed","geoengineering proposal","led university","quick fix","university bristol","university oxford","principal investigator"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,4,4,4,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":488}
