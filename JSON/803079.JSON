Readings taken from a variety of sources, such as Aristotle, Machiavelli, Bacon, Hobbes, Locke, the Founding Fathers, and the Bible. Case studies include written analyses and films that address engineering disasters, biotechnology, court cases, ethical codes, and the ultimate scope and aims of engineering. D. Doneson, B. L.
