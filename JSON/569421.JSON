According to the company’s Global Solar Demand Monitor report for the second quarter, despite the record year the global solar industry had in 2015, the slight slowdown that is expected throughout 2016 is only set to deepen in 2017. Specifically, GTM Research ties the expected slowdown to “policy turmoil” in China, Japan, and the UK, despite huge growth expected","m_szDocBody":"global solar market facing major shift ahead gtm
