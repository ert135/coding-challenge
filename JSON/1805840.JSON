According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), global energy intensity, measured as energy consumption per unit of GDP, has decreased by nearly one-third between 1990 and 2015. Further, energy intensity has decreased in nearly every region on the planet, with reductions seen in both OECD nations and emerging economies","m_szDocBody":"global energy intensity continue longterm steady decline joshua hill figure energy information administration show global energy intensity continued twentyfive year decline energy information administration eia global energy intensity measured energy consumption unit gdp decreased onethird further energy intensity decreased region planet reduction oecd nation emerging economy however year percentage change pronounced nonoecd country compared oecd country primary difference oecd nonoecd country level existing industrialization nonoecd country process industrialising relying energyintensive manufacturing technique form energy use industrialised world country transitioned servicesbased economy energy intensive unsurprisingly extension necessity energy efficiency policy oecd nonoecd country increase energy productivity fascinatingly representative economic growth development past couple decade china experienced largest increase energy productivity unsurprisingly growing date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter havent reader survey yet now ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2016/07/14/global-energy-intensity-continues-long-term-steady-decline/","m_Places":["China"],"m_People":["Joshua S Hill"],"m_Companies":["Us Energy Information Administration","Eia","Oecd"],"m_BiGrams":["energy intensity","nonoecd country","global energy"],"m_TriGrams":["global energy intensity"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[4,4,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":138}
