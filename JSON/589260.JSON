They are a set of related technologies, many of which can generate electricity from a number of hydrocarbon fuels rather than hydrogen. I limited my recent post on the rapid rise of hydrogen stocks to just U.S.-listed companies involved in the production and use of hydrogen, leaving out foreign stocks and other fuel cell
