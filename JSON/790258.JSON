May 18th, 2008 by Rod Adams   One of my frequent frustrations is getting involved in an energy policy discussion with someone that goes something like this: Them: I am deeply concerned about global climate change and the effects of mankind’s continued use of dirty fossil fuels on our planet’s health. Me: I used to operate power plants that produced zero emissions. What do you think about taking a new look at using nuclear power to replace fossil fuel consumption? Them: I do not like nuclear power.
