Most of this (1.4 GW) was commercial installations. Residential PV solar for the same period was just 410 MW . For Q2 this ratio was a reversal of the prior period, which favored residential solar installations over commercial. If you guessed that it was the national feed-in-tariff scheme that fueled the continued solar surge, you were correct. The FIT did not arise on its own, however.
