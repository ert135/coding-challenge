This was a good start. However, it is my view that the President’s endorsement for nuclear energy didn’t go nearly far enough. In fact, by not including the entire nuclear sector under the definition of “qualified alternative energy resources,” we may very well threaten our nation’s ability to become truly energy independent or come remotely close to meeting the new U.S. pledge","m_szDocBody":"president obama recently announced support nuclear power plant smaller megawatt size known small modular reactor smr clean energy source executive order good start however president endorsement nuclear energy didnt enough fact including entire nuclear sector definition qualified alternative energy resource threaten nation ability energy independent remotely close meeting pledge cut greenhouse gas emission president embrace nuclear power clean energy source subgroup industry current fleet nuclear power plant generate energy avoid billion tonne air emission key point ignored this today surrounded increased amount consumer good require plugged recharged accessible whenever wherever smartphone bigger tvs electric vehicle smart product connecting internet iot modern economy energy intensive widespread efficiency conservation effort case consistent source clean baseload power generation supplied nuclear sector critical ever applaud technological innovation redefining renewable commercialization battery storage solution make renewable competitive however renewable long reaching power generating level nuclear industry clean energy president focus nuclear energy credible bridge fuel natural gas burning natural gas electricity create lot air pollution carbon emission this switched coalfired electrical generation natural gas emit billion tonne tonne carbon dioxide atmosphere single year nuclear energy coexist renewable energy source play vital role helping quickly adopt sustainable lowcarbon lowair pollution energy landscape president expect meet new stringent climate goal energy information administration eia reporting oil output jumped year lot misconception risk form energy production including nuclear yet today nuclear industry vastly year ago including advance uranium production method needed supply today nuclear industry fact modern uranium mining cleaner safer production rare earth element china essential produce renewable energy lead topic energy independence import roughly uranium fuel current fleet nuclear power plant rare earth mineral needed produce renewable china enjoy nearmonopoly production highlighted recent minute piece therefore declaring nation energy independent flawed thinking nuclear power account energy power generation committed reducing air pollution producing domestic reliable clean energy source president move qualify nuclear power clean energy resource smr technology appealing excited president smr technology clean energy solution but shouldnt nuclear facility uranium fuel needed run smr receive clean energy distinction stephen antony president ceo energy fuel nyse mkt uuuu year antony held increasingly senior position technical managerial sector mining uranium industry company including mobil energy fuel nuclear inc power resource inc consulted cameco corp antony served president ceo energy fuel served chief operating officer extensive experience uranium exploration ore production mill processing registered professional engineer graduate colorado school mine hold master business administration university denver newsmax finance right reserved comment close ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/Markets/obama-nuclear-power-clean-energy-air-pollution/2015/05/10/id/643733/","m_Places":["United States","China"],"m_People":["Barack Obama","Stephen Antony"],"m_Companies":["Energy Information Administration","Eia","Mobil","Power Resources Inc.","Cameco Corp","Mill","Colorado School Of Mines","Business Administration","University Of Denver"],"m_BiGrams":["clean energy","nuclear power","energy source","power plant","nuclear energy","nuclear industry","natural gas","energy fuel"],"m_TriGrams":["nuclear power plant","clean energy source"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[7,6,4,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":404}
