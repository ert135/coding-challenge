And it’s not science fiction.     Nocera stated that even if we put all available acreage into fuel crops, all available acreage in wind power , and build a new nuclear power plant every 1.5 days, and we save 100% of our current energy use (yes, you read that correctly","m_szDocBody":"mit professor power house litre water day derek markham aspen environment forum today mit professor dan nocera gave
