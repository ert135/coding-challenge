November 8th, 2013 by Joshua S Hill   MIT’s Charles Forsberg has come up with an idea that might work to combine nuclear energy generation with renewable energies in an effort to halt the need for fossil fuels. The idea proposes combining a nuclear power plant with another renewable energy system, which Forsberg argues “could add up to much more than the sum of its parts.” Earlier this week four leading climate scientists published an open letter asking “those influencing environmental policy” to step down from indiscriminately opposing nuc","m_szDocBody":"hybrid nuclear plant stem global warming joshua hill mit charle forsberg idea work combine nuclear energy generation renewable energy effort halt fossil fuel idea propose combining nuclear power plant renewable energy system forsberg argue add sum part earlier week leading climate scientist published open letter askingthose influencing environmental policy step indiscriminately opposing nuclear power option letter outlined current nuclear power feasible option divest fossil fuel halt rising global warming climate energy scientist concerned global climate change writing urge advocate development deployment safer nuclear energy system author letter wrote adding continuedopposition nuclear power threaten humanity ability avoid dangerous climate change fortuitously timed release mit announced charle forsberg research scientist mit department nuclear science engineering published paper journalenergy policy advocating coupling nuclear power alternative energy source create hybrid power plant time approaches forsberg believe thinking box fight global warmingas long inexpensive fossil fuel electricity demand reason said address climate change curb greenhouse gas emission secure energy independence fossil fuel economy control vast reserve option necessary nuclear power renewable energy wind solar pros con comparatively inexpensive nearinfinitely beneficial environment atmosphere fossil fuelbased energy system reliability suffer due specific intricacy nuclear power rapidly ramped meet reduce production renewable energy reliant stable weather condition create constant power similarly ramped specific need solution forsberg create excess power nuclear power plant diverted making dispatchable power source easily ramped balance disparity production demand how pairing nuclear power plant artificial geothermal storage system hydrogen production plant shaleoil recovery system steam generated nuclear power plant diverted affect alternative energy solution creating hybrid system stability reactiontime traditional fossil fuel power station time formative gamechanging approaches single technology way combining technology saidsteven aumeier director centre advanced energy study idaho national laboratory hybrid energy system gamechanging approach enabling costeffective secure penetration lowcarbon energy economy aumeier add system afford practical regionally scalable mean approach energy security ken caldeira senior scientist department global ecology carnegie institutiondr kerry emanuel atmospheric scientist massachusett institute technologydr jame hansen renowned climate scientist columbia university earth institute anddr tom wigley climate scientist university adelaide national centre atmospheric research author open letter published earlier week recommendation embrace development deployment safer nuclear power system technology essential credible effort develop energy system rely atmosphere waste dump long run light nuclear incident looming spectre ukrainian chernobyl disaster recent fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster nuclear energy wellliked public eye solution ill greater majority nuclear energy attractive option fossil fuel implementing sort nuclear energy longterm solution tricky proposition authority attempt benefit outweigh negative cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter joshua hill christian nerd geek pretty quickly directing planetearth hell handbasket write fantasy book review couk found writing article variety site cheque aboutme more related post ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2013/11/08/hybrid-nuclear-plants-help-stem-global-warming/","m_Places":["Idaho","Chernobyl","Fukushima","Uk"],"m_People":["Joshua S Hill","Charles Forsberg","Steven Aumeier","Ken Caldeira","Kerry Emanuel","James Hansen","Tom Wigley"],"m_Companies":["Ramped","Carnegie Institution","Massachusetts Institute Of Technology","Columbia University","Earth Institute","University Of Adelaide","National Center For Atmospheric Research"],"m_BiGrams":["nuclear power","fossil fuel","nuclear energy","power plant","energy system","renewable energy","climate scientist","climate change"],"m_TriGrams":["nuclear power plant"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[11,6,5,5,5,4,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":466}
