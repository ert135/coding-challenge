rose okay then respect ceric hydrate sale broke bit differently press release past excuse wrong sale sillame facility dont ceric hydrate sale mountain pass working now mark smith good analysis short period time anthony good new good new taking ceric hydrate material lower purity level cerium sending sillame upgraded cerium oxide cerium carbonate higher price higherpurity material customer material sold purposeful decision made increase purity level product increase number customer sell good benefit future anthony young dahlman rose okay shouldnt viewed signal weakness cerium market mark smith close that anything introduce cerium proactive way meet customer specification anthony young dahlman rose okay question guy mark smith bet anthony you operator next michael gambardella jpmorgan michael gambardella jpmorgan chase yes good afternoon taking call mark smith michael michael gambardella jpmorgan chase question recent pricing rare earth there heard comment cerium data source get cerium price high july kind realisation hitting downward realisation hitting p&l mark smith well bunch way contract material absolutely doubt asian metal metalspage reduction late july early timeframe reduction bit differently ive business year cerium price year career here selling average price lower kilogramme part year kilogramme today very attractive price low cost production company yes price off late july early cerium reached kilogramme more dont lot material moving kilogramme accurate number term ultimately price realisation michael gambardella jpmorgan chase give ballpark realisation cerium quarter number put mark smith jim dont top head michael offline michael gambardella jpmorgan chase okay question give update cost expect facility retrofitted facility cost inline cost estimate srk report mark smith yeah havent changed number all expect kilogramme average cost production coming mountain pass michael gambardella jpmorgan chase okay lot mark bet michael care operator next jagadish iyer piper jaffray jagadish iyer piper jaffray yeah taking question mark question wanted you that kind challenging provide pricing guidance fourth quarter give slide shortage threat metric tonne week quarter give idea pricing trended end quarter please mark smith guess weve far jagadish stabilisation price kind now interesting that amazing loud market price reached peak late early august price back range now word people back market theyre buying material lot painful price hearing customer addressed rational pricing environment now jagadish iyer piper jaffray that wanted out volume project phoenix completed end year holding confidence accomplish end year that week end year mark smith great question great deal confidence process qualifying material very lengthy process final stage qualification test customer mean turn commercial legal discussion contract fact part commercial discussion occurred matter final written contract signed party qualification process lightly dont make oxide material sell customer make material provide qualification sample cheque specification run qualification make material work process great deal effort great deal time glad molycorp position produce sample qualification purpose jagadish iyer piper jaffray just may quick follow sillame wanted cost advantage guy refining compared here please jame allen cost advantage knowhow technology advantage working hard part transition make technology mountain pass sillame back shared broadly widely can youll effect working very hard sillame operation advance technology weve developed mountain pass lower cost bringing back lot technology producing knowhow sillame mountain pass make higher higher purity material good exchange two jagadish iyer piper jaffray net versus gross jame allen yeah paretosh sorry youre talking metric tonne paretosh misra morgan stanley yeah metric tonne mark smith inaudible reduction jame allen yeah net versus gross there paretosh net metric tonne sold mountain pass total facility metric tonne reo equivalent paretosh misra morgan stanley build inventory quarter mark smith matter effect sold lot inventory recall number sale production paretosh misra morgan stanley right guy you mark smith next luisa moreno jacob security luisa moreno jacob security inc hello luisa moreno jacob security inc mark all wanted congratulate molycorp progress made producing oxide metal sillame pretty significant youre company china that mark smith you luisa moreno jacob security inc question focused heavy rare earth comment made mark smith yes luisa moreno jacob security inc moly option listed recycling deposit positive mountain pass world question point dont answer point important advanced recycling deposit identified mountain pass mark smith interesting answer luisa advanced part heavy rare earth strategy cracking technology molycorp developed process full ore body mountain pass include bastnasite monazite cracking technology worked very level tested commercial scale unit expected online excited watch continue successful produce heavy rare earth mountain pass deposit advanced real local heavy rare earth laden deposit found luisa moreno jacob security inc okay monazite youre processing youre planning combine mix bastnasite understanding that thorium there found monazite thorium addressing that mark smith monazite bastnasite combination existed mountain pass open pit mining operation weve very lowlevel signature uranium thorium ore body past processing limitation crack bastnasite monazite milling process discarded monazite material tailing basin processed bastnasite material cracking process monazite process stream process bastnasite dont expect additional amount uranium thorium result this uranium thorium number total number ore body anyway operator you dan mazer harvest capital dan mazer harvest capital good afternoon taking question earlier today company granted chinese quotas publicly stated pretty good chance half quotas half quotas unused end year thought appear suggest limited supply deficit rare earth demand disruption production supply chain inaudible love thought
