Motor vehicles are responsible for emitting about half of all airborne smog-creating particles and nitrogen oxide . Currently, there are two major camps which have developed in the world of alternative automotive fuels: electric vehicles (EVs) typically powered by energy st","m_szDocBody":"blog fuel cell vehicle
