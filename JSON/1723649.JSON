Tesla’s autopilot allows higher speed driving on divided highways. ZMANMD A lot of people are stating the autopilot feature does not work at more than 5 mph above the speed limit.  This speed limit is only applicable to non-divided highways.  On divided highways with a median (such as the one in the crash) the driver is free to select whatever speed he wants to risk getting ticketed for.
