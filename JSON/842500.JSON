Today's hybrid cars are driven by electric motors powered by both batteries and an ICE. Most commonly used when refering to petroleum-electric hybrid vehicles, the Hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) uses gasoline (petrol) or diesel to power internal-combustion engines (ICEs), and electric batteries to power electric motors.
