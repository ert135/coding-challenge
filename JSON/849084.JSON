Several years ago I read about small modular nuclear power plants.  I think the size was about 50K?  They were to use tennis ball-sized carbon fiber fuel pellets.  A standard design and small size were intended to reduce the high design, building costs and construction time. By continuing, I agree that I am at least 13 years old and have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
