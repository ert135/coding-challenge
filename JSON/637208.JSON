August 14, 2014 by 8 Comments With more than 7 billion people on the planet, one of the most critical molecules manufactured industrially is also one of the simplest, NH3, ammonia. If the industrial synthesis of ammonia were to stop tomorrow, billions of people would undoubtedly be consigned to starvation: The original meaning of the term “green revolution” referred not to fantastic rhetoric about wind and solar power, among other things, but rather, beginning in the 1950’s, to the development, and industrial application of intensive fertilization schemes being
