While a battery introduction may not seem like a world-changing event to many, it actually heralds the beginning of the “First Energy Revolution” and will begin to remake the world as we know it. The Story So Far: We all know the world runs on energy, but we’ve been conditioned over the last couple of generations to see energy as something that requires careful conservation and conscious usage.
