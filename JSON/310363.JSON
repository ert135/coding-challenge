fossil fuel human activity interview glen peter senior research fellow centre international climate environmental research oslo scientist global carbon project discussed china pose big challenge curbing global warming latest global carbon budget china prominently ever that all country emitting carbon dioxide wealthy country higher average emission person china undergone unprecedented economic structural decade true carbon dioxide emission china emitted percent global emission international energy agency wrote chinese emission remain united state then chinese emission grown percent year passing united state emission china emit percent global carbon dioxide emission united state european union combined double emission united state alone china percapita emission percent global average higher percapita emission european union sixty percent growth global emission due china china emitted total united state european union preindustrial time gap fast closing major happening china world eye china china emit lot carbon big country make lot rest world chinas emission byproduct export lesson draw that percent chinese emission produce product exported consumed china year production export accounted half growth chinese emission chinese negotiator mentioned rhetorically media formally negotiation export important economic growth china suggesting exported emission responsibility country invitation country regulate exported emission prospect placing border carbon adjustment carbon chinese export raised trading partner notably united state contrast carbon intensity chinese economy chinese export benefit climate china production capacity country rival china ability drive cost solar wind renewable technology case chinese export climate benefit focus needed leveraging chinese production beneficial climate chinas carbon emission growth recently slowed significant falloff coal demand research caution assuming permanent slowing emission growth china why careful annual emission percent rebound global carbon dioxide emission global financial crisis good example chinese emission grew percent lowest rate due part lower economic growth average previous decade faster expected improvement carbon intensity economy meaning emission growth slower economic growth improvement carbon intensity represent effect chinese policy aimed reducing emission rapid expansion renewable technology energy efficiency local pollution control emission trading system few nevertheless year data needed confirm lasting trend annual variability important concept work global carbon

france belgium sweden led reduction percent year lasted decade mitigation challenge china immense sound daunting explain implication chinese scientist official chinas carbon emission growing possibly

availability key technology carbon capture storage analyse focus global level hiding countryspecific detail impression mitigation easy sufficient political societal support engineering reality ground different china moving forward stronger stronger climate policy unclear chinas current level ambition consistent keeping global warming degree arithmetic small remaining emission quota mean china emit emit bring issue equity fairness directly debate positive progress chinese climate policy reality that consistent degree peak decline chinese emission occur sooner faster youve that failure advanced country cutting emission china chance lead climate negotiation make kind emission reduction mind hurting economy know great deal reluctance china making put economic growth risk country historical
