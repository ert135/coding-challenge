How susceptible will autonomous vehicles be to “autonomous hijacking,” or to snoopers and stalkers for that matter? Can the sensors of such autonomous vehicles be easily spoofed to cause accidents? With those and related questions in mind, researchers at the Chinese security firm Qihoo 360, the University of South Carolina, and Zhejiang University in China, recently ","m_szDocBody":"jame ayre topic continually discussion autonomous driving technology potentialvulnerability hacking malicious intent susceptible autonomous vehicle autonomous hijacking snooper stalker matter sensor autonomous vehicle easily spoofed accident related question mind researcher chinese security firm qihoo university south carolina zhejiang university china recently work teslas autopilot system finding potential fault highly motivated people personal damage property damage wouldnt cheap practical option case relying signal generator other full suite technology function generator ultrasonic transducer andarduino computer background here current autopilotenabled tesla vehicle rely cameras radar ultrasonic sensor provide input driving software autoblog somedetail stating that start usc professor wenyuan xus team stuck signal generator cart front stationary model simulate vehicle switching rig car vanished teslas sensor warning obviously jammer easy acquire portable indeed continuing jamming radar pricey proposition ultrasonic sensor easier target albeit lower speed ultrasonic sensor manage model selfparking summon feature equipment cost function generator arduino computer ultrasonic transducer xus team manipulated sensor object wasnt cloak was teslas camera system resilient attack researcher shined laser led cameras blind them xus team managed kill pixel camera sensor autopilot simply shut warned driver wheel jam camera commenting research cautioning overreaction finding stated wired dont send signal sky falling shouldnt autopilot attack require skill tesla adding detection mechanism well noise extremely high abnormal radar warn central data processing system working properly tesla issued reply asked work stating reviewed result wenyuan team reproduce realworld case pose risk tesla driver researcher work presenting upcoming defcon hacker conference drive electric car complete short survey electric car report date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag hacker hacking tesla autopilot tesla hacking tesla motor jame ayre background predominantly geopolitic history obsessive interest pretty everything early life spent imperial free city dortmund jame river ruhr cofbuokheim attended university astnide briefly considered entering coal mining business write living broad variety subject ranging science politic military history renewable energy follow work google related post ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2016/08/06/researchers-expose-potential-tesla-model-s-autopilot-vulnerabilities-extremely-expensive-difficult-hack/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IM-cleantechnica+%28CleanTechnica%29","m_Places":["China","Free City","Dortmund"],"m_People":["James Ayre","Professor Wenyuan"],"m_Companies":["University Of South Carolina","Zhejiang University","Tesla","Signal","Indeed","Target","Tesla Motors","University Of Astnide","Google"],"m_BiGrams":["ultrasonic sensor","xus team"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":327}
