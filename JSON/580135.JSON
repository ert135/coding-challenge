In many instances the electrical energy powers an electric motor used to propel the aircraft. In some instances, the electric output from the fuel cell would be augmented by power from special high power “surge” batteries for critical takeoff and climbing, where the maximum electric power is required. In preferred embodiments, such fuel cell powered aircraft will supply oxygen to the fuel cell either from a container of oxygen carried","m_szDocBody":"fuel cell powered electric aircraft electrically
