We've heard much about new environmentally sound electric cars but only recently have hydrogen powered cars been in the news. The most common nuclear reactor is an LWR (Light Water Reactor) and it can produce electricity but also can make large amounts of hydrogen at low production cost. In the process, using electrolysis nuclear power can split water into it's elements of hydrogen and oxygen. Basics of Nuclear Energy The U.S. has 103 nuclear power plants in 31 states. These reactors provide about 20% of the electricity t","m_szDocBody":"solar cooking nuclear energy power hybrid vehicle heard environmentally sound electric car recently hydrogen powered car new common nuclear reactor lwr light water reactor produce electricity make large amount hydrogen low production cost process electrolysis nuclear power split water element hydrogen oxygen basic nuclear energy nuclear power plant state reactor provide electricity country use fuel uranium mined country world uranium widely subject supply shortage associate fossil fuel make electricity fact country source uranium fifty percent total uranium nuclear energy today supplied mine canada australia nuclear reactor controlled fission create chain reaction fuel rod releasing extreme temperature heat heat power turbine generator produced electrical power process make hydrogen power car logical combination demand today greener cleaner product climate change global warming pollution air water result year industrial advance drew increasing amount power produced burning fossil fuel focus centralised automotive industry car major contributor pollution number car road continue increase green car focus politician public hybrid car combined gasoline power engine electric battery power battery limited range recharging needed hybrid car designed save gasoline battery efficient environmental problem remain car recharged electricity electricity produced fossil fuel burning power plant benefit found hybrid car power generated nuclear energy battery charged electricity created environmentally safe way hybrid vehicle increase popularity usefulness green energy avoid gasoline produced oil electric battery charged electricity product coal tradeoff fossil fuel another accepted consumer accident caused nature rippling effect japan japanese proactive encouraging hybrid vehicle powered electricity nuclear reactor encourage hybrid car japanese government offered large subsidy citizen drive hybrid growth electric vehicle sale japan question due nuclear incident damaged reactor permanently shut public sentiment favour building nuclear installation future led japanese government announce development water wind farm wind turbine constructed massive coast japan boost energy production replace closed nuclear facility shortfall nuclear energy resulting power cut region motor industry japan taking financial hit sale hybrid car fallen hybrid car promotion successful spite government subsidy auto maker building electric car sale remained stagnant move hydrogen driven automobile proposed attract buying public environmentally friendly vehicle however nuclear energy power hybrid car effort fail now summary clean energy produced nuclear reactor provide electricity hydrogen power car pollution accustomed hybrid car make sense nuclear energy used recharging battery making hydrogen environmentally sound power generated fossil fuel burning plant scepticism nuclear energy power hybrid vehicle public fear radiation leak reason dislike smaller hybrid car another united state huge country vast land space crisscrossed highway hybrid car reach speed power gasoline powered vehicle green car urban transportation primary vehicle newsletter ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_general","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.alternative-energy-geek.com/nuclear-energy-and-hybrid-cars.shtml","m_Places":["United States","Canada","Australia","Japan"],"m_People":[],"m_Companies":["Japanese Government"],"m_BiGrams":["hybrid car","nuclear energy","fossil fuel","hybrid vehicle","nuclear reactor","energy power","power hybrid"],"m_TriGrams":["nuclear energy power","energy power hybrid"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[10,8,5,4,4,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":416}
