I’ve been running a marathon lately to cover all the major players that may provide viable alternatives to fossil fuels this century. Even though I have not exhausted all possibilities, or covered each topic exhaustively, I am exhausted. So in this post, I will provide a recap of all the schemes discussed thus far, in matrix form. Then Do the Math will shift its focus to more of the “what next” part of the message. The primary “mission” of late has been to sort possible future energy resources into boxes labe","m_szDocBody":"alternative energy matrix tmurphy view month breathe neo ive running marathon cover
