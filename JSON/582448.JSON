A Abstract The invention relates to a nickel anode for a zinc-nickel battery, which mainly comprises a positive plate filled with an active material by adopting a foam nickel substrate through a dry method or wet method process, wherein a part uncovered by the material on the edge of the positive plate is formed with an afflux belt which has excellent performance and can reduce the electron motion distance and the impedance; one side of the positive plate is welded by a nickel foil and a pole plate to extend with a conducting shockproof connect","m_szDocBody":"nickel anode zincnickel
