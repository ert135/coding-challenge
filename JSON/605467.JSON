To smooth out those peaks and valleys, Hawaii will rely on the latest refinements in 150-year-old battery technology and some ingenious software. Dennis Hollier January, 2016 Batteries are old. In a sense, the last major development in battery technology was the invention of the lead-acid battery in 1859 by the French physicist Gaston Plante.
