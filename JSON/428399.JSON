The entomopter is a species of micro air vehicle (MAV), which is defined as a flying vehicle having no dimension greater than 15 cm. The entomopter mimics the flight characteristics of an insect by flapping wings to generate lift. The entomopter's wings are powered by a reciprocating power source. The same power source may be used to power legs to enable the entomopter to crawl along the ground.
