Researchers at Stanford report that “peak oil” — and the related fears that we have depleted the Earth’s supply of oil so much that we will run into greater conflicts between supply and demand that will stimulate social unrest and economic problems — are unwarranted. They conclude that the demand for oil – as opposed to the supply – will reach its own peak and then decline.
