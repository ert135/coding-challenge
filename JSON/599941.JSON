Then along came some major countries who showed that it didn’t, and that there really are no limits to renewable integration. The result was explained last year in a Bloomberg Business piece aptly headlined , “Germany Proves Life With Less Fossil Fuel Getting Easier”: “Germany experiences just 15 minutes a year of outages, compared with 68 minute","m_szDocBody":"renewable revolution unstoppable credit shutterstock tweet comment time people imagined replacing fossil fuel renewable solar wind jeopardise electric grid
