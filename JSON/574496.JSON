The compressor and storage tanks deliver the high-pressure working air and operational flows to several stages of compressors that boost the pressures during driving to very high-pressure, then ultra high-pressure, then super high-pressure, and finally to extremely high-pressure. A pneumatic torque converter uses jets of the extremely high-pressure to turn an input shaft of a transmission and dif","m_szDocBody":"magnetic motor automobile magnetic motor automobile carry
