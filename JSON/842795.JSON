Research Institute and Idaho National Lab Energy Strategy Recommendation Six goals are defined to achieve this vision: 1) Maintain today’s nuclear fleet of light water reactors 2) Significantly expand the fleet with advanced light water reactors 3) Develop non-electric applications for high-temperature reactors 4) Assure safe, long-term used fuel management 5) Assure long-term nuclear sustainability 6) Strengthen United States leadership internationally Specific objectives are developed for each goal, and R&D to support them is summarized in three technology areas: • Light
