Share: FULL STORY Decentrally organised electricity supply: According to a study carried out by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, electricity control devices, so-called smart meters, can tailor the electricity supply from nuclear power plants and wind farms to the demand from industry and households based on a self-organised process.
