Even though European car makers are focusing on electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, that doesn’t mean that research into fuel cell cars is not moving forward as well. In particular, BMW is exploring hydrogen power for its future cars and Mercedes is doing so as well. Now 6 European companies have announced a consortium that will build 400 hydrog","m_szDocBody":"hydrogen fueling station germany steve hanley week storey hydrogen fuel cell powered bicycle linde
