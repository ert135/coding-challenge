DETAILED DESCRIPTION New battery applications demand continuous improvements in battery discharge rate capabilities and a corresponding decrease in charge times. However, when a conventional Li-ion battery is charged at a relatively high rate, e.g., greater than 2C, a decrease in the negative electrode potential due to impedance brings the negative electrode below the potential at which lithium plating occurs. This voltage drop may be due to ohmic resistance, concentration polarization, charge transfer resistance, and other sources of impedance.
