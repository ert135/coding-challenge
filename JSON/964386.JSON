valentin gapontsev telecom share telecom total revenue contribution growth revenue year minimum compare year expect additional growth time growing integrated solution provide market found fit dont expect business time growing faster total revenue joe maxa okay opportunity valentin gapontsev arab country russia working direction joe maxa you operator you question line jagadish iyer redstone technology research ahead question jagadish iyer yes taking question tim valentin question first steadily past quarter inventory kind inventory level foresee business shaping year sequel gross margin followup timothy mammen think ipg back inventory grew say three year ago relative revenue growth invested heavily working capital year relative change inventory compared revenue growth strip benefit foreign exchange same historically benefit flowing gross margin buildup inventory year normalised weve lot work internally company focusing area aligning production expected demand now youre growing range youre invest working capital dont impact gross margin relative year inventory growth year level equal revenue impact gross margin planning jagadish all jagadish iyer okay china number automotive company pretty skilled demand expectation half year youre strong demand china lag couple quarter china disconnect regard sale versus automotive company alluding you timothy mammen dont necessarily disconnect think china expectation year moderate compared take account automotive general manufacturing take account strength areas directly indirectly related battery welding part relate automotive
