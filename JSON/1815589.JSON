Is it possible that the elusive “decoupling” of emissions and economic growth could be happening? The statistic is startling. In the past two years, the global economy has grown by 6.5 percent, but carbon dioxide emissions from energy generation and transport have not grown at all, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported last month.
