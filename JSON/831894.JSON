The different combinations of states of various torque-transfer devices yield multiple modes of operation. The planetary gear train allows the addition of power of two prime-movers to drive the load. In addition it also allows splitting the power from one prime-mover into requirements of the energy storage system while catering to the output needs. This it achieves in a manner' so as to limi","m_szDocBody":"hybrid transmission system abstract invention relate degreesof freedom compound planetary gear train conjoined planetary gear train
