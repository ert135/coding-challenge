New Studies Provides The Answer April 1st, 2016 by James Ayre   Energy efficiency measures are often touted as an effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, of lessening new project investment needs, and of reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels, but to what degree are these assertions true? How much do the implementations of such measures themselves cost?
