Without change, in less than 20 years enough fossil fuel will have been burnt to increase average global temperature by an average of 2 degrees Celsius. Some areas in the Arctic are already 5 degrees Fahrenheit above average. Urgent action is required. Coal and oil needs to stay in the ground and other sources of power need to be implemented quickly. But such a transition will not happen overnight.
