If the past is prologue, the future vehicle fl eet will be larger, heavier, and more powerful as well as still largely dependent on fossil fuels. Rising travel demand may be offset by gains in fuel economy, but without intervention, the desired aggressive reductions in fossil energy use or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
