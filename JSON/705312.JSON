funding fuel sale energy innovation hub three course budget absolutely nowhere prospect here sec chu well good idea decrease funding fuel sale innovation hub hopeful know optimism continued optimism forward hoping congress convinced wisdom hub based early track record one term fuel sale look tough choice certainly part happen continuing again make tough choice support industry pursuing fuel sale before time fuel sale part easiest part sense progress made great deal commitment industry unsolved problem hydrogen from know solved problem know cut make emphasis explain inaudible small modular reactor inaudible sec chu sure small modular reactor incredible opportunity build reactor centralised factory stamp serve market united state rest world areas power plant dont infrastructure sustain oneto gigawatt reactor make sort bitesized chunk utility company whoever investing dont bet real fraction entire company asset make forward world market department energy very positive small modular engineering design nrc licencing research opportunity united state capture leadership role nuclear sector before made nuclear reactor lost france japan korea china wanting world player market united state lot offer reactor concept programme new include work small modular noticed difference million total small reactor project smr part reactor concept include million dollar work give break sec chu well breakdown youre referring part helping company engineering design licenced approval million dollar additional r&d funding directly helping company licenced approval couple year purview nrc give breakdown reactor concept programme aim hope sec chu advanced concept steve isakowitz said advanced design example know aircooled reactor socalled gen reactor gen iii cooling vessel pump more possibly safe gen different really radically design aircooled reactor aircooled pebble bed reactor nature yes secretary oil plan sell spr congressional approval second plan this spending year start that earlier year sec chu yeah yes situation oil cavern technical difficulty drain cavern partially anyway part prompted that timing know steve exact timing exact timing part budget request reauthorization sec chu yeah were sale draining cavern there itd put cavern creating overfill situation sell inaudible sec chu yes certainly know lot congressional control wait that well happen budget year before happen budget year begin happen sec chu well hope congress give permission overfill other dont oil spilling out work congress that certainly work congress yes dollarperwatt goal solar shot break fraction sort applied research role solution coming from basic research arpae play role dollarperwatt sec chu sure well looked entire chain cost instal dollar installed utility scale multimegawatt field now roughly half cost call balance system module itself electronic mounting installation fee know land rental landuse fee nature depend call basic research fund radically example funding research silicon photo cell polycrystalline silicon photo cell call research usual term sawing wafer polishing doping completely system taking molten silicon dripping directly removing melted molten solidified silicon onethird onequarter thickness that work scaled commercial system totally making oldfashioned silicon photo cell invented know late lab innovative possibility funding researchy material taking true material turning upside down plate glass know olden day year ago glass molten wiggly stuff building sudden figured float glass liquid flat smooth inexpensive revolutionised glassmaking thing silicon type thin film cig cad telluride thing electronic make electronic reliable installation cost cleaning reflector that everything applied basic basic radical manufacturing bend think know thinking end century there secretary congress make argument youre increasing fossil fuel subsidy price energy reasonable argument transition inaudible future cost energy inaudible interest sec chu well personally cost fuel subsidy oil gas industry spoke billion fold into know recent report guy major multinational corporation making term revenue profit very small fraction that secretary talk generation nuclear power plant specifically funding allocated funding for programme sec chu let see what exact number gen youre gen small modularcross talk generation nuclear power plant hightemperature gascooled reactor sec chu yeah forget scale million dollar dont know okay million generation ngnp sec chu okay ngnp okay used sec chu reactor design widely deployed certainly commercial scale research say know feasibility study correct wrong nrc approval either lot preliminary work gascooled reactor pete lyon add okay yes looked looked quickly term grid storage back grid talk bit kind youre battery device breakdown sec chu yeah yes battery pump storage scale amount storage finding depending store load shifting biggest kind storage pumped storage pump water hill compressedair storage scale battery storage very valuable taking highfrequency transience renewable wind solar cloud nature levelizing enable full output let say wind farm now burst wind sudden lull burst wind feather blade throw energy dump somewhere battery turning valuable taking full ability wind farm capture energy put line used first interface system battery scale funding way increasing battery largescale storage megawatt power multimegawatt power megawatthour scale arpae funded number line liquid battery talked about couple other wide open space improve battery technology mean driving cost down cost largerscale battery like sulfurflow battery typically dollar kilowatthour hope lot open its again making energy infrastructure useful weve efficient grid system part secretary year budget request doe choose seek reauthorize payment uraniumenrichment d&d fund doe increase amount uranium conduct environmental management work sec chu hand ins ins triay continue transfer uranium exchange cleanup service course market analysis depending assurance impact uranium market adversely continue exchange uranium cleanup service secretary deep cut house including energy confident congress appropriate know budget this resemble budget sec chu well day time budget presentation president request budget winning future budget president made tough choice department energy board agency this steve isakowitz said budget eisenhower administration held flat pledge hold flat year priority laid budget fact department energy budget increase reflect deep commitment president feel part energy playing winning future creating job tomorrow year making united state competitive forward important energy sector competition know part confidence department carry out yes fossil research development number programme coal sharply reduced entirely reason decrease funding represent shift focus technology potential benefit existing fossil fuel plant sort technology are know focused sec chu put context year recovery act lot money invested recovery act money invested demonstrating technology demonstrated nearcommercial scale heavy privatesector partnership involved now forward realising budget reality forward lot technology deployed today newer technology totally change landscape capture carbon stack amine chilled ammonia presentday technology piloted world united state absorb carbon dioxide small particle release system energy cost releasing particle separation technique oxyburn oxyburn separate oxygen air now cryogenically again great cost great investment nanotechnology membrane order that investing that lot programme saying okay budget reality future committed driving cost carbon capture sequestration continue sequestration part programme important prove number geological site safe confidence american people stored safely securely long period time again hard choice decided wanted put emphasis remain committed drive cost ccs drive cost lot great ideas there okay question end chuckle yes give followup made strong statement funding environmental management full compliance figure say oak ridge million dollar saw dont close would based earlier negotiation federal facility agreement there compliance speak that sec chu well detail million dollar ill ins talk about triay efficient term recovery act funding oak ridge activity order million work closely state regulator added million requesting feel sufficient ensure compliance oak ridge sec chu actually say pat back bit recovery act period amazing thing lot ahead budget ahead schedule bit leftover okay glad give detail that secretary chrysler loan application affected budget status that sec chu moving ahead chrysler dont affected budget okay you ","m_szGeo1":"United
