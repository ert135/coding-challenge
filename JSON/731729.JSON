However, critics say there is no demonstrable demand for SMRs, that they are likely to prove more rather than less expensive, and still produce nuclear waste for which there is no proven solution. In the March 2016 budget, the government announced a £250 million competition to identify an SM","m_szDocBody":"small modular nuclear reactor energy policy price small modular nuclear reactor recent
