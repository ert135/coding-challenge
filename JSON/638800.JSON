Power stations were big and costly, built next to coal mines, ports, oil refineries or—for hydroelectric generation—reservoirs. Many of these places were a long way from the industrial and population centres that used the power. The companies’ main concern was to supply the juice, and particularly to meet peaks in demand. Most countries (and in America, regions) were energy islands, with little interconnection to other systems. That model, though simple and profitable for utili","m_szDocBody":"tweet basic model electricity industry send voltage long distance passive customer power station big costly built coal mine port oil
