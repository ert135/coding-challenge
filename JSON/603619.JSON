British low-cost airline carrier EasyJet has detailed an innovative plan to build an eco-friendly hybrid airplane fitted with a hydrogen fuel cell. Still at the embryonic stage of development, the hybrid drivetrain is built around hydrogen fuel cells located in the cargo hold. A regenerative braking system similar in concept to the one found in many hybrid and electric cars harvests the massive amount of kinetic energy generated when the plane brakes during landing and channels it to the cells. Once the aircraft comes to a full stop, the cells transfer the ene","m_szDocBody":"delivered inbox free british lowcost airline carrier easyjet detailed innovative plan build ecofriendly hybrid aeroplane fittedwith hydrogen fuel cell embryonic stage development hybrid drivetrain built hydrogen fuel cell located cargo hold regenerative braking system similar concept found hybrid electric car harvest massive amount kinetic energy generated plane brake landing channel cellsonce aircraftcome full stop cell transfer energy lightweight battery packsused topower electric motor built wheel time planetaxis related mercede loungelike hydrogenpowered autonomous van ian davy head easyjet engineering department point percent fuel flight burned taxiing easyjet flight taxi minute average represent roughly million mile year consequently fitting hydrogenhybrid system plane carrier fleet potentially save tonne annually easyjet substantially trim fuel budget move couldreduce cost flying passenger technology retrofitted existing airplane making major modification fuselage additionally easier implement budget carrier easyjet bigger companiessuch delta airline air france fact lowcost carrier people hand luggage hull empty space explaineddavy interview cnn hydrogen system hasother unexpected advantage starter water vapour emitted hydrogen fuel cell fill plane water system airport markedly quieter supertug past hydrogenhybrid plane drive gate power easyjet expect tobegin testing hydrogen technology end year passenger wont ride hydrogenpowered plane year plan pilot programme year technology trickle production plane year davy ","m_szGeo1":"France","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/easyjet-hydrogen-hybrid-plane-details-project-specs/","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Ian Davies","Four Million Miles"],"m_Companies":["Easyjet","Delta Airlines","Air France","Cnn"],"m_BiGrams":["hydrogen fuel","fuel cell"],"m_TriGrams":["hydrogen fuel cell"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":198}
