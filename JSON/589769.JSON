Paul Roberts speaks to a UK energy technology company with a strong pedigree in fuel cell development that is steering a range-extender project in that direction The debate surrounding vehicle emissions is never far from the headlines and given the recent focus on diesel engines, NOX is under the microscope just as mu","m_szDocBody":"home analysis fuel cell taking wider commercial fuel cell
