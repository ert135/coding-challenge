Electricity generation - what are the options? Electricity is vital to modern life. It powers our lights and appliances at home. It powers many industry processes. It is used to power trains and to charge electric vehicles. Globally, electricity use is rising rapidly as new major economies develop in places such as China and India. This need for electricity drives a growing demand for electricity generation, with thousands of new power plants needed across the world over the coming decades Every form of electricity generati","m_szDocBody":"home nuclear basic electricity generation option electricity generation option electricity vital modern life power light appliance home power industry processe power train charge electric vehicle globally electricity rising rapidly major economy develop place china india electricity drive growing demand electricity generation thousand power plant needed world coming decade form electricity generation strength weakness future electricity generation range option low carbon greenhouse gas emission reduced nuclear generation reliable supply electricity low carbon emission small amount waste safely stored eventually disposed decade electricity consumed world generated form power plant fossil hydro nuclear renewable generate small share world electricity share growing fast fossil fossil fuel power plant burn carbon fuel coal oil gas generate steam drive large turbine produce electricity plant generate electricity reliably long period time however burning carbon fuel produce large amount carbon dioxide climate change produce pollutant sulphurous oxide acid rain cottam power plant coal gas burner edf energy fossil fuel plant require huge quantity coal oil gas fuel transported long distance price fuel rise sharply time shortage leading unstable generation cost large hydro large hydro power plant generate electricity storing water vast reservoir massive dam water dam flow turbine generate electricity flow river dam hydro dam generate large amount electricity however dry period drain reservoir flooding reservoir dam slowing flow river dam impact ecology dam number site suitable dam limited nuclear nuclear power plant heat produced nuclear fission generate steam drive turbine fossil fuel plant however greenhouse gase produced fission process small amount produced fuel cycle point beach nuclear power plant usa nextera nuclear fuel reactor year fuel remain time stored recycled make fuel carefully disposed however amount fuel generate electricity fossil fuel plant practical nuclear fuel waste emission fossil fuel nuclear power plant run month interruption providing reliable predictable supply electricity nuclear power plant generate electricity month time interruption nuclear generation safest environmentally damaging form electricity generation renewable renewable wind solar small scale hydro produce electricity greenhouse gas emission point generation low amount greenhouse gas emission entire lifecycle cost electricity generation renewable higher form generation requiring subsidy compete form generation cost coming down wind turbine norway ievltd renewable produce electricity predictably consistently electricity generation wind turbine vary wind speed wind weak strong electricity produced all output solar panel reliant strength sunshine depend time day amount cloud cover mean renewable backed form electricity generation fossil fuel generation resultant greenhouse gas emission share ","m_szGeo1":"China","m_szSourceType":"source_general","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics/electricity-generation-what-are-the-options.aspx","m_Places":["China","India","Uk","United States","Norway"],"m_People":[],"m_Companies":["Fossil"],"m_BiGrams":["electricity generation","power plant","generate electricity","fossil fuel","greenhouse gas","gas emission","form electricity","produce electricity","plant generate","fuel plant","nuclear power"],"m_TriGrams":["greenhouse gas emission","form electricity generation","plant generate electricity","fossil fuel plant","nuclear power plant"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[9,9,5,5,4,4,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[4,3,3,3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":393}
