Most people agree that global warming is a disturbing reality â€“ and Venice, more than other city on the planet, is in the firing line if sea levels rise. Dubbed the floating city, Venice is under threat from all sides. Not only does the place flood more than 100 times a year, the entire city itself is sinking at the ","m_szDocBody":"share share google academic eco tech trailblazer car running hydrogenpowered fuel
