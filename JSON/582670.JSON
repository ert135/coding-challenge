In the USA and other developed countries, the increasing cost of fuel advances technologies to develop integrated systems to lower the cost of usage of fossil fuel, as well as lowering our dependence on foreign oil. This technology works on demand and does not store large amounts of explosive gas. The fuel byproducts of combustion are also less toxic that are prod","m_szDocBody":"field invention invention relate hydrogen fuel cell technology specifically technology involved element produce
