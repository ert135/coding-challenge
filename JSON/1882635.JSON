Many people believe that oil prices will just go up--but I don't see that to be the case. A more likely result is a future dominated by recession and debt defaults--similar to what we have been seeing recently, but trending over time to be worse. In the midst of this recession, the view may be that there is plenty of oil, if only the price were higher. Views of Oil Prices One view is that energy prices will ","m_szDocBody":"oil fossil fuel deplete gail tverberg cdt energy resource oil deplete people oil price upbut case result future dominated

peakoil oil energy price rising scalable substitute found expect oil price rise current price barrel barrel barrel barrel eventually barrel more problem account amount money people spend oil energy price rise people additional income cover higher expenditure real life price expect happen oil price bounce back again recessionary impact credit crunches caused oil price time oil price end uncomfortable middletoo economy buzz along low encourage oil production renewable production result continuing recession worse time generally viewed inadequate demand oil energy price energy expenditure big share income income people people minimum wage close minimum wage oil price folk price food gasoline price home heating electricity because price type energy tend move together budget stretched cut back discretionary spending default loan repayment similar situation people earn minimum wage live paycheck paycheck pretty spend money earn price energyrelated good rise people cutback cut back discretionary good default loan repayment both thus oil price rise energy price general rise end main effect bank worse condition loan default economy start feeling recessionary impact people cut back buying discretionary good impact lead well bank make loan problem default people laid work reduced demand discretionary good restaurant meal vacation home car home furnishing example cutback purchase home car home furnishing lead impact price home drop because fewer upgrading expensive home loan harder get demand oil because oil making car home thing also fewer people vacation fewer people drive work reduce oil usage demand natural gas coal electricity manufacturing discretionary good round effect become people default loan decline home value owe home home worth happen people

state local government revenue shortfall recession continue difficult government continue borrow more expenditure outpace income eventually government left option raise taxe reduce service revenue expense back line default debt make situation worse government raise taxe effect citizen pretty higher oil energy price citizen react cutting back discretionary spending defaulting loan back problem recessionary problem loan default before government layoff worker increase recessionary effect small government default debt world accommodate default pretty easily problem spread large number big country united state japan example international trade disrupted seller good payment prevent happening again seller good set stricter termsi sell oil sell wheat return example amount trade drop precipitously cumbersome nature trading government raise taxe reduce service expect result recession debt default lower price energy product say plenty oil natural gas coal uranium ground price higher
