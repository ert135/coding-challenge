I am your host Russell R. Chianelli, MRS president in 1990 and career researcher in energy materials: batteries, catalysts, hydrogen storage and solar cells. We all recognize the importance of energy in the coming years for global economic growth and security. We also recognize that energy production in any form has environmental consequences that must be considered. Materials research is key to the development and maintenance of reliable and safe energy sources which are affordable and ","m_szDocBody":"material energy material research society mrs material energy blog host russell chianelli mrs president career researcher energy material battery catalyst hydrogen storage solar cell recognise importance energy coming year global economic growth security recognise energy production form environmental consequence considered material research key development maintenance reliable safe energy source affordable environmentally acceptable purpose material energy blog discuss scientific issue surrounding areas material energy basic research scaleup commercialization deployment environmental impact including raw material acquisition finally disposal technology order effectively discuss issue invited sery expert cohost assist guiding discussion current article resource discussion encourage interested party engaging discussion suggest mrs bulletin harnessing material energy organic led efficient fluorescent lamp researcher germany created led organic material efficient traditional lighting team university dresden report power efficiency potential maximum standard led made inorganic material found widespread application screen commercial lighting efficiency recent year researcher started develop wave led organic material polymer ecofriendly dispose led advantage generating photon range colour resulting white light now team physicist redesigned internal structure organic led produce significantly brighter white light promising creating white light coat led phosphor convert monochromatic light red green blue light drawback lack efficiency photon generated remain trapped led emission substrate surrounding phosphor research team overcame problem optimising coupling phosphor polymer layer integrating blue green red phosphor heart emission layer created system significantly photon escape standard fluorescent tube generate light power efficiency organic led efficiency device exhibit efficiency building community dialogue global energy landscape material innovation month preliminary release mrs bulletin issue harnessing material energy anecdotal evidence received positive comment request bulk quantity healthy single copy sale continue distributed wide scientist policymaker energy leader educator student europe asia africa elsewhere goal liked goal used time cover build dialogue community placing full spectrum energy technology source transformation efficiency shown preface illustration energy landscape introduction challenge opportunity lie ahead worrying future joining researcher entrepreneur corporation building robust solution important challenge emerged scientific approaches speed progress learn experiment world sugarcane ethanol brazil hydrogen iceland nuclear power france coal liquefaction south africa wind energy germany electric car israel solar california implementation trump stronger development tomorrow needed widespread cellulosic ethanol white led general lighting nuclear breeder reactor carbon sequestration methane hydrate organic solar cell plugin hybrid reader blog give thoughtful input unanswered question unquestioned answer related material energy start introductory mrs bulletin issue harnessing material energy material research next add comment here future post examine article issue suggestion future blog coverage emailed elizabeth fleischer material research ","m_szGeo1":"Germany","m_szSourceType":"source_general","m_szSrcUrl":"http://materialsforenergy.typepad.com/materials/lighting/","m_Places":["Germany","United States","Europe","Asia","Africa","Brazil","Iceland","France","South Africa","Israel","California"],"m_People":["Russell R.
