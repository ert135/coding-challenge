Knittel and Ryan Sandler∗ September 20, 2015 Abstract A basic tenet of economics posits that when consumers or firms don’t face the true social cost of their actions, market outcomes are inefficient. In the case of negative externalities, Pigouvian taxes are one way to correct this market failure, where the optimal tax leads agents to internalize the true cost of their actions. A practical complication, however, is that the level of externality nearly always varies across economic agents a","m_szDocBody":"welfare impact uniformpigouvian taxation evidence transportation
