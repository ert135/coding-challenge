fighting climate change simple paying close attention and conserve energy david newell say robert bernal saith the world half developed yet thatmerefossil fuel stay affordable longer not billion

labourer finally benefit move renewable solar power wind businesse technology entrepeneur part support california silicon valley push renewable limit carbon robert bernal say nice post point environmentalist issue beware rollnevertheless people reason its big conspiracy enslave higher energy price truth excess raise energy price profit other correlation higher higher temp argued denier prove preceeded other fact truth statement but warming higher level and course good ole get rid syndrome all long continue productive electricity drive buy from market current energy situation hope converted denier following remove preindustrial concentration air planet colder proven infrared absorber required earth warm thus add more heat logarithmic slightly linear scale proven added large substantial fraction entire biosphere planet sure understand clean energy expensive end fossil fuel expensive anyway thus debate develop clean energy anyway fossil fuel right however burn store carelessly fossil fuel wisely order build energy economy contrary environmentalist say energy conservation efficient remainder fossil fuel world half developed yet mere fossil fuel stay affordable longer not billion energy hungry people start working transition asap way develop wind solar storage nuclear make cheap machine make solar cheap enough cover close half million square mile land just order power humanity humanely nuclear meltdown proof design mass produced factory setting proper disposal fission product remain radioactive year yes awesome reactor design wind built cheaper too point max integration inspire market build cheaper utility scale storage advanced machine automation see future clean energy based price past disbelieve gore preaches practicing jetsetting tax energy conference world time true totallyirrevalent gore preach clean energy scale needed anyway anything clouding anymore disbelieve proven temp preceeded higher level irrevalent geologic past ice cap continent air reaked methane prior oae caused mass dieoff excess volcanism caused ocean acidification global warming and subsequent feedback lower albedo ect gave hydrocarbon store disbelieve environmentalist jack price energy true stillirrevalent pay higher price energy way say great inventor closed cycle nuclear listening knew many decade ago gore excess eventually problem completely alter atmosphere entire planet ocean acidification global warming simply cheat physic bty save hydrocarbon intended use electronic keyboard jessica hate picky clarify comment made state air order
