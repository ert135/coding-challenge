install 200 SP2 units, and after changing of the main turbines in Power plant, using a “ladle hand” system of SP2, we can propel the same generators and use all existing infrastructure to produce the same electric power -- but without any dangerous nuclear fuel!\" ( PureEnergyBlog ; May 2, 2013) Fun","m_szDocBody":"newshydro nov started compiling hydrorelated new here featured top hydro river
