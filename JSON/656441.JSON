For the last two weeks it has traded between $102-103 a  barrel with little change.  Much of the strength in New York prices has  come from the opening of the Keystone pipeline from Cushing, Okla. to  the Gulf which has resulted in 288,000 b/d being drained from the  Cushing depot to Gulf Coast refineries in recent days. By the end of the  year, the pipeline should be able to move 700,000","m_szDocBody":"peak oil review tom whipple originally published aspousa oil global economy york oil climbed barrel month
