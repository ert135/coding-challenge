Thursday, July 30, 2015 The Ford Nucleon, Electric Cars and the Swiss Thought Experiment Hereâ€™s something I did not know existed, even as far as it did exist: In the 1950s, perhaps the height of the so-called Atomic Age, Ford developed a concept car called the Ford Nucleon. This nuclear-powered automobile was designed, according to Ford , based on the assumption that future nuclear reactors would be smaller, safer, lighter and more portable. The design called for a power capsule located in the rear of the car, cha","m_szDocBody":"nei nuclear note new commentary commercial nuclear energy industry thursday ford nucleon electric car swiss
