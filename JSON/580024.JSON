transport lithium take place providing higher discharge power thus example lithium iron phosphate based cathode prepared average crystallite size graphite based anode slurry particle size micrometre micrometre micrometre crystallite size necessarily particle size particle consist agglomerate aggregate individual crystallite embodiment electroactive material slurry varied provide power capability fuel system model provide consumer tank size unlike conventional vehicle size fuel tank determined time manufacturing invention ability readily exchange slurry tank refuelling provide tank size need
