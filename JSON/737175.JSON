See more hybrid car pictures . Have you pulled your car up to the gas pump lately and been shocked by the high price of gasoline ? As the pump clicked past $20, $30, $40 or even $50, maybe you thought about trading in your car for something that gets better mileage. Or maybe you're worried that your car is contributing to the greenhouse effect . The auto industry has the technology to address these concerns. It's the hybrid car.
