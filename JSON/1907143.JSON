In one embodiment, a source transistor is provided, with current sourced at the drain. A feedback network runs from the source node to the gate. The feedback network produces voltage gain by a transconductance, such as a transistor. Appropriate capacitors are also provided, and two pairs of switches are disposed to provide offset cancellation by toggling between gain and clamp modes in the switched capacitor architecture.
