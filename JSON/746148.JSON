The Japanese government subsequently found itself moving at the behest of public opinion to decommission many of its nuclear facilities and pushing towards a renewable energy future. However, the damage done to the facility was not caused by the earthquake or resulting tsunami itself, but rather the aftereffects, specifically the lack of cooling for the reactor cores due to the
