Owing to the theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh/kg, the lithium-sulfur battery is considered one promising candidate for next-generation, high-energy battery solutions. However, shortcomings in fast capacity degradation and low cycling efficiency haven't been solved, which hinders the practical application of lithium sulfur battery ","m_szDocBody":"ternarylayered separator retard shuttle polysulfide highlystable lithiumsulfur battery highenergydensity battery essential meet demand future application portable electronic electrical vehicle owing theoretical energy density lithiumsulfur battery considered promising candidate nextgeneration highenergy battery solution however shortcoming fast capacity degradation low cycling efficiency solved hinder practical application lithium sulphur battery system researcher tsinghua university proposed ternarylayered separator system lithiumsulfur battery long lifespan coulombic efficiency sulphur utilisation generation rechargeable lithiumsulfur battery rely multielectron transfer redox chemistry qiang zhang tsinghua university physorg except energy density lithiumsulfur battery advantage routine lithiumion battery cheap cathode material lowtemperature operational performance advantage lithium sulphur system exist inherent shuttle effect polysulfide intermediate lithiumsulfur cell such shuttle effect low coulombic efficiency induce capacity degradation consumption active sulphur internal chemical reaction jiaqi huang associate professor tsinghua university research made great effort ionselective separator lithiumsulfur cell based physical confinement electrostatic repulsion researcher covered surface routine polymer separator ultrathin graphene oxide nanosheet cast thin nafion layer structure ternarylayered separator macroporous polypropylene separator serve matrix layer mechanical strength separator sheet formed layer small channel lithium ion transportation served compact barrier layer oxygenated functional group anchor nafion way significantly lower area loading nafion retarding layer maintain permselectivity lithium ion polysulfide anion electrostatic repulsion size selective effect effective strategy tingzhou zhuang master candidate research group total functional loading layer routine separator ternary separator incorporated lithiumsulfur battery discharge capacity improved mah coulombic efficiency increased lino additive decay rate decreased cycle selfdischarge inhibited sulphur utilisation reached sulphur loading amount membrane modification demonstrated effective method lithiumsulfur battery ternary membrane structure make building block multilayered composite separator efficient singlelayer separator strategy open opportunity developing multifunctional separator battery qiang zhang proofofconcept ternary separator layered rationally designed fabricated applied lis battery improved sulphur utilisation coulombic efciency long cycling life work offer concept ternary system rational combination building block hierarchical structure indispensable fully demonstrate role ternary system multifunction multiapplication ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://phys.org/news/2016-01-ternary-layered-retard-shuttle-polysulfides-highly-stable.html","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Zhang","Jia","Huang"],"m_Companies":["Tsinghua University","Lifespan","Matrix"],"m_BiGrams":["lithiumsulfur battery","ternarylayered separator","tsinghua university","coulombic efficiency","sulphur utilisation"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":305}
