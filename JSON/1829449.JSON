groundless price rare earth back reasonable value speculative spike lasted year extractive area saudi arabia managing oil resource keeping unextracted way counteract price swing saudi arabia reported increase oil production time market price lower time low price simmon however role saudi arabia world main swing producer demonstrated oil price widely swinging past decade furthermore recent collapse oil price started ongoing saudi made major attempt control price decreasing amount exported oil best therefore argue occasion saudi policy acted limit price swing claimed saudi arabia refrained prospecting oil areas territory order future exploitation again proven ace case described clear evidence government industrial company consistently strategy keeping resource underground produced sold profit world market problem that free market economy government power force private company stop producing mineral resource obvious problem decision country limit stop extraction resource territory tantamount embargo directed country similar resource available extreme limit action invite military retaliation happened instance time arab oil embargo oil crisis consideration simply leaving resource underground strategy widely implemented future landfill stockpiled resource chemistry created destroyed mineral laboriously extracted mine disappear end trajectory underground again industrial marketing cycle end mining process extracted processed mineral dispersed environment form and part dumped landfill waste incineration treatment question landfill considered future strategic supply
