The Chamber of Mines has installed a platinum fuel cell generator, a technology that, like solar and wind, could get a huge boost from economies of scale. (Delwyn Verasamy, M&G) The Chamber of Mines in central Johannesburg has power even when load-shedding brings the rest of the country, including the chamberâ€™s own members, to its knees.
