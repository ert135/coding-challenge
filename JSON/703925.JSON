Global energy demand is growing rapidly with a continued reliance on fossil fuels  IEA projects global demand will rise by one third from 2010 to 2035  Major role of emerging economies in energy markets and entering energy-intensive phase of growth  China and India to account for 50% of world growth  Fossil fuels will remain important component of supply for decades  80% of global supply
