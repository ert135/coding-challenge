The bus bars are each connected to respective one of electrodes of the metallized film capacitor. The internal case contains the metallized film capacitor. The metallized film capacitor is submerged with molding resin in the internal case so as to expose parts of the bus bars. The external case contains the internal case and both cases are connected at a connecting part.
