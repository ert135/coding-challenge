The electric pulse is varied (e.g. like a square wave) and it is found that the metal deposits during negative cycle while polymer deposits during positive cycle. This gives control over the size of the nanoparticles. The mode of operation is galvanization and, hence, the deposition occurs on one of the electrodes. The matrix material for nanoparticles can be the electrode or the electrolytic medium.
