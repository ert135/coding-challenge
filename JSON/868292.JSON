The country is all over hydrogen like white on rice. In the latest development, a new project will divert excess wind power from Scotland’s Orkney Islands to produce renewable hydrogen for a fleet of fuel cell EVs. A BIG HIT For Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles The name of the new project is BIG HIT, for Building Innovative Green Hydrogen systems in an Isolated Territory. The aim is to make some use out of the excess wind energy generated by","m_szDocBody":"tina casey hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle plenty critic new failed reach scotland country hydrogen white rice latest development project divert excess wind power scotland orkney island produce renewable hydrogen fleet fuel cell evs big hit hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle project big hit building innovative green hydrogen system isolated territory aim make excess wind energy generated turbine orkney island shapinsay eday goal first transition island energy independence state hawaii similarity hawaiian island struggling imported fossil fuel generation state percent energy independence track include wind solar renewable hydrogen orkney island exporting windgenerated electricity however havent make full renewable energy domestically shapinsay eday turbine frequently curtailed averaged percent capacity unused partly due grid restriction wondering orkney island dont simply upgrade grid deploy excess wind power battery use good question big hit project part broader plan introduce renewable hydrogen technology scotland european union big hit won grant eus fuel cell hydrogen joint undertaking demonstration learning model future project part eus plan earlier demonstration project called orkney surf turf initiative eday divert eday excess tidal wind electricity electrolyser device produce hydrogen splitting water molecule surf turf designed demonstrate hydrogen transportation usage production compressed hydrogen electrolyser eday landsea route kirwall harbour power fuel cell portrelated task fuel cell electricity port building berthed ship speaking hawaii similar demo project there solar energy wind evidently surf turf success big hit aim bringing fuel cell evs mix plan fleet battery electric van retrofitted fuel cell range extender fuel station built provide them project introduce hydrogen running boiler provide heat itm power supply electrolyser big hit ring bell thinking company recently installed windpowered hydrogen fuel station fuel cell evs advanced manufacturing park south yorkshire fuel cell chicken egg goal orkney project represent attempt solve classic chickenandegg obstacle commercial scale fuel cell deployment buy fuel cell hydrogen fuel station station fuel cell attracting interest major auto company fuel cell initiative prodded startup waless riversimple movement introduce fuel cell company plan price point obstacle offering rasa fuel cell sedan basis cost competitive leasing typical gasmobile california joined hawaii test bed fuel cell commercialization state slowly very slowly establishing chain hydrogen station pace change pick cost fcevs drop issue plenty coverage sister site gasorg mile range typical fuel cell sedan rapid refuelling strong selling point factor touched hot market shipping logistic industry place premium emission quick refuel forklift vehicle street vehicle coming slowly fuel cell field give battery evs run moneyeventually ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://gas2.org/2016/05/01/despite-doubters-hydrogen-fuel-cell-evs-way-scotland/","m_Places":["Scotland","United States","Hawaii","Wales","United States , California"],"m_People":["Tina Casey"],"m_Companies":["State Of Hawaii","European Union","Eu"],"m_BiGrams":["fuel cell","big hit","hydrogen fuel","orkney island","excess wind","renewable hydrogen","cell evs","surf turf","fuel station"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[19,6,4,4,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":400}
