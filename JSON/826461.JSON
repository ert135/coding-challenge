Mission 2016 proposes that governments enforce regulations on companies and use cutting-edge technology to reduce the damage from mining-related sources. As more mines open in countries with varying levels of environmental protection, it is increasingly vital that safeguards established by the Strategic Minerals Association (SMA) are in place before operations proceed (see the international regulation pag","m_szDocBody":"environmental risk mining arise effect mitigated overview unregulated mining potential release harmful substance soil air water
