One of Switzerland’s leading energy companies, the KWO, operates just such a complex hydropower system in the country’s Grimsel Pass, and it’s facing some interesting changes with the addition of wind and solar energy to the grid mix — and the forthcoming loss of nuclear generating capacity in Switzerland, too.
