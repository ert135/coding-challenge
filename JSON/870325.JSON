Danny King Hydrogen fuel cell technology can be considered a \"best of both worlds\" approach to cleaner mobility because of its shorter, conventional-vehicle-like fill-up times, full-tank range, and zero-emissions proposition. The problem is that both the vehicles and hydrogen distribution systems are costly to produce, so the sector has so far been very narrow. And with just three hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in production â€“ Toyota Mirai , Honda Clarity , a","m_szDocBody":"ihs hydrogen percent market cheaper production greener fuel supply required broader
